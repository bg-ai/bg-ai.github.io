<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: Again I shall declare to you this supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained to supreme perfection.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From the Seventh Chapter to the end of the Twelfth Chapter, Sri Krsna in detail reveals the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Now, the Lord Himself is further enlightening Arjuna.</p>
<p>If one understands this chapter through the process of philosophical speculation, he will come to an understanding of devotional service.</p>
<p>In the Thirteenth Chapter, it was clearly explained that by humbly developing knowledge one may possibly be freed from material entanglement.</p>
<p>It has also been explained that it is due to association with the modes of nature that the living entity is entangled in this material world.</p>
<p>Now, in this chapter, the Supreme Personality explains what those modes of nature are, how they act, how they bind and how they give liberation.</p>
<p>The knowledge explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be superior to the knowledge given so far in other chapters.</p>
<p>By understanding this knowledge, various great sages attain perfection and transfer to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>The Lord now explains the same knowledge in a better way.</p>
<p>This knowledge is far, far superior to all other processes of knowledge thus far explained, and knowing this many attain perfection.</p>
<p>Thus it is expected that one who understands this Fourteenth Chapter will attain perfection.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By becoming fixed in this knowledge, one can attain to the transcendental nature, which is like My own nature.</p>
<p>Thus established, one is not born at the time of creation nor disturbed at the time of dissolution.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge, one acquires qualitative equality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, becoming free from the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>One does not, however, lose his identity as an individual soul.</p>
<p>It is understood from Vedic literature that the liberated souls who have reached the transcendental planets of the spiritual sky always look to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, being engaged in His transcendental loving service.</p>
<p>So, even after liberation, the devotees do not lose their individual identities.</p>
<p>Generally, in the material world, whatever knowledge we get is contaminated by the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>But knowledge which is not contaminated by the three modes of nature is called transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>As soon as one is situated in that transcendental knowledge, he is on the same platform as that of the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Those who have no knowledge of the spiritual sky hold that after being freed from the material activities of the material form, this spiritual identity becomes formless, without any variegatedness.</p>
<p>However, just as there is material variegatedness in this world, so, in the spiritual world, there is also variegatedness.</p>
<p>Those in ignorance of this think that spiritual existence is opposed to material variety.</p>
<p>But actually, in the spiritual sky, one attains spiritual form.</p>
<p>There are spiritual activities, and the spiritual situation is called devotional life.</p>
<p>That atmosphere is said to be uncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>To obtain such knowledge, one must develop all the spiritual qualities.</p>
<p>One who thus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or the destruction of the material world.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, and it is that Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings, O son of Bharata.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due to the combination of ksetra and ksetrajna, the body and the spirit soul.</p>
<p>This combination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the Supreme God Himself.</p>
<p>The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the total cosmic manifestation, and because in the total substance of the material cause there are three modes of nature, it is sometimes called Brahman.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes become possible.</p>
<p>This total material substance, the mahat-tattva, is described as Brahman in the Vedic literature: tasmad etad brahma nama-rupam annam ca jayate.</p>
<p>Into that Brahman the seeds of the living entities are impregnated by the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>The twenty-four elements, beginning from earth, water, fire and air, are all material energy, called Maha-brahman, or the great Brahman, the material nature.</p>
<p>As is explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is another, superior nature--the living entity.</p>
<p>In material nature the superior nature is mixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thereafter all living entities are born of this material nature.</p>
<p>The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the scorpion is born out of rice.</p>
<p>But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion.</p>
<p>Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother.</p>
<p>Similarly, material nature is not the cause of the birth of the living entities.</p>
<p>The seed is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material nature.</p>
<p>Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a different body, created by this material nature, and the entity can enjoy or suffer according to his past deeds.</p>
<p>The Lord is the cause of all the manifestations of living entities in this material world.</p>

<p>It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse it is clearly explained that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the original father of all living entities.</p>
<p>The living entities are combinations of the material nature and the spiritual nature.</p>
<p>Such living entities are seen not only on this planet, but in every planet, even in the highest where Brahma is situated.</p>
<p>Everywhere there are living entities; within the earth there are living entities, even within water and within fire.</p>
<p>All these appearances are due to the mother, material nature, and Krsna's seed-giving process.</p>
<p>The purport is that the living entities, being impregnated in the material world, come out and form at the time of creation according to their past deeds.</p>

<p>Material nature consists of the three modes--goodness, passion and ignorance.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The living entity, because he is transcendental, has nothing to do with this material nature.</p>
<p>Still, because he has become conditioned by the material world, he is acting under the spell of the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Because living entities have different kinds of bodies, in terms of the different aspects of nature, they are induced to act according to that nature.</p>
<p>This is the cause of the varieties of happiness and distress.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is illuminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions.</p>
<p>Those situated in that mode develop knowledge, but they become conditioned by the concept of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types.</p>
<p>One is happy, another is very active, and another is helpless.</p>
<p>All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities' conditioned status in nature.</p>
<p>How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The mode of goodness is first considered.</p>
<p>The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned.</p>
<p>A man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge.</p>
<p>The representative type is the brahmana, who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>This sense of happiness is due to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from sinful reactions.</p>
<p>Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.</p>
<p>The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness, he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others.</p>
<p>In this way he becomes conditioned.</p>
<p>The best examples are the scientist and philosopher: each is very proud of his knowledge, and because they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material happiness.</p>
<p>This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature.</p>
<p>As such, they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for working in that way, they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature.</p>
<p>Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Repeatedly, one may become a philosopher, a scientist, or a poet, and, repeatedly, become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death.</p>
<p>But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of Kunti, and because of this one is bound to material fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman.</p>
<p>Woman has attraction for man, and man has attraction for woman.</p>
<p>This is called the mode of passion.</p>
<p>And, when the mode of passion is increased, one develops the hankering for material enjoyment.</p>
<p>He wants to enjoy sense gratification.</p>
<p>For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with nice children, wife, and house.</p>
<p>These are the products of the mode of passion.</p>
<p>As long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard.</p>
<p>Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities.</p>
<p>In order to please his wife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work.</p>
<p>Therefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion.</p>
<p>Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standards of the mode of passion.</p>
<p>Formerly, the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>If there is no liberation for those in the mode of goodness, what of those who are entangled in the mode of passion?</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O son of Bharata, the mode of ignorance causes the delusion of all living entities.</p>
<p>The result of this mode is madness, indolence and sleep, which bind the conditioned soul.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant.</p>
<p>This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul.</p>
<p>This mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can understand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite.</p>
<p>Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman cannot understand what is what.</p>
<p>Instead of making advancement, one becomes degraded.</p>
<p>The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic literature: under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand the thing as it is.</p>
<p>For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died, and therefore he will also die; man is mortal.</p>
<p>The children that he conceives will also die.</p>
<p>So death is sure.</p>
<p>Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night, not caring for the eternal spirit.</p>
<p>This is madness.</p>
<p>In their madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>Such people are very lazy.</p>
<p>When they are invited to associate for spiritual understanding, they are not much interested.</p>
<p>They are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion.</p>
<p>Thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required.</p>
<p>Six hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day.</p>
<p>Such a man appears to be always dejected, and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping.</p>
<p>These are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance.</p>

<p>A person in the mode of goodness is satisfied by his work or intellectual pursuit, just as a philosopher, scientist, or educator may be engaged in a particular field of knowledge and may be satisfied in that way.</p>
<p>A man in the modes of passion and goodness may be engaged in fruitive activity; he owns as much as he can and spends for good causes.</p>
<p>Sometimes he tries to open hospitals, give to charity institutions, etc.</p>
<p>These are the signs of one in the mode of passion.</p>
<p>And the mode of ignorance covers knowledge.</p>

<p>Sometimes the mode of passion becomes prominent, defeating the mode of goodness, O son of Bharata.</p>
<p>And sometimes the mode of goodness defeats passion, and at other times the mode of ignorance defeats goodness and passion.</p>

<p>This competition is always going on.</p>

<p>The prominence of some certain mode of nature is manifested in one's dealings, in his activities, in eating, etc.</p>
<p>All this will be explained in later chapters.</p>
<p>But if one wants, he can develop, by practice, the mode of goodness and thus defeat the modes of ignorance and passion.</p>

<p>By the manifestation of particular activities, it can be understood in what mode of nature one is situated.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By acting in the mode of goodness, one becomes purified.</p>
<p>Works done in the mode of passion result in distress, and actions performed in the mode of ignorance result in foolishness.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By pious activities in the mode of goodness one is purified; therefore the sages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness.</p>
<p>Similarly, activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable.</p>
<p>Any activity for material happiness is bound to be defeated.</p>
<p>If, for example, one wants to have a skyscraper, so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built.</p>
<p>The financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth, and those who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil.</p>
<p>The miseries are there.</p>
<p>Thus Bhagavad-gita says that in any activity performed under the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery.</p>
<p>There may be a little so-called mental happiness--&quot;I have this house or this money&quot;--but this is not actual happiness.</p>
<p>As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life.</p>
<p>Animal life is always miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy, maya, the animals do not understand this.</p>
<p>Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them.</p>
<p>That is the law of nature.</p>
<p>In human society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged.</p>
<p>That is the law of the state.</p>
<p>Because of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Every living creature is the son of the Supreme Lord, and He does not tolerate even an ant's being killed.</p>
<p>One has to pay for it.</p>
<p>So, indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest kind of ignorance.</p>
<p>A human being has no need to kill animals because God has supplied so many nice things.</p>
<p>If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark.</p>
<p>Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk.</p>
<p>Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature the words gobhih prinita-matsaram indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by milk, is desirous of killing the cow, is in the grossest ignorance.</p>
<p>There is also a prayer in the Vedic literature that states:</p>
<p>namo brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca jagaddhitaya krsnaya govindaya namo namah.</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the brahmanas, and You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world.&quot;</p>
<p>The purport is that special mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Brahmanas are the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, the brahmanas and the cows, must be given all protection--that is real advancement of civilization.</p>
<p>In modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged.</p>
<p>It is to be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation.</p>
<p>A civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization.</p>
<p>The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>It is a very dangerous age, and all nations should take care to provide the easiest process, Krsna consciousness, to save humanity from the greatest danger.</p>

<p>From the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion, grief develops; and from the mode of ignorance, foolishness, madness and illusion develop.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since the present civilization is not very congenial to the living entities, Krsna consciousness is recommended.</p>
<p>Through Krsna consciousness, society will develop the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>When the mode of goodness is developed, people will see things as they are.</p>
<p>In the mode of ignorance, people are just like animals and cannot see things clearly.</p>
<p>In the mode of ignorance, for example, they do not see that by killing one animal they are taking a chance of being killed by the same animal in the next life.</p>
<p>Because people have no education in actual knowledge, they become irresponsible.</p>
<p>To stop this irresponsibility, education for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be there.</p>
<p>When they are actually educated in the mode of goodness, they will become sober, in full knowledge of things as they are.</p>
<p>Then people will be happy and prosperous.</p>
<p>Even if the majority of the people aren't happy and prosperous, if a certain percentage of the population develops Krsna consciousness and becomes situated in the mode of goodness, then there is the possibility for peace and prosperity all over the world.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the world is devoted to the modes of passion and ignorance, there can be no peace or prosperity.</p>
<p>In the mode of passion, people become greedy, and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no limit.</p>
<p>One can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangement for sense gratification, there is neither happiness nor peace of mind.</p>
<p>That is not possible because one is situated in the mode of passion.</p>
<p>If one wants happiness at all, his money will not help him; he has to elevate himself to the mode of goodness by practicing Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One engaged in the mode of passion is not only mentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also very troublesome.</p>
<p>He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough money to maintain his status quo.</p>
<p>This is all miserable.</p>
<p>In the mode of ignorance, people become mad.</p>
<p>Being distressed by their circumstances, they take shelter of intoxication, and thus they sink further into ignorance.</p>
<p>Their future in life is very dark.</p>

<p>Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more explicitly set forth.</p>
<p>There is an upper planetary system, consisting of the heavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated.</p>
<p>According to the degree of development of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be transferred to various planets in this system.</p>
<p>The highest planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka, where the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahma, resides.</p>
<p>We have seen already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in Brahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring us to this.</p>
<p>The mode of passion is mixed.</p>
<p>It is in the middle, between the modes of goodness and ignorance.</p>
<p>A person is not always pure, but even if he should be purely in the mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich man.</p>
<p>But because there are mixtures, one can also go down.</p>
<p>People on this earth, in the modes of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the higher planets by machine.</p>
<p>In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of becoming mad in the next life.</p>
<p>The lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abominable.</p>
<p>The result of developing ignorance is very, very risky.</p>
<p>It is the lowest quality in material nature.</p>
<p>Beneath the human level there are eight million species of life: birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc., and, according to the development of the mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these abominable conditions.</p>
<p>The word tamasah is very significant here.</p>
<p>Tamasah indicates those who stay continually in the mode of ignorance without rising to a higher mode.</p>
<p>Their future is very dark.</p>
<p>There is opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to be elevated to the mode of goodness, and that system is called Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>But one who does not take advantage of this opportunity certainly will continue in the lower modes.</p>

<p>One can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature simply by understanding them properly by learning from the proper souls.</p>
<p>The real spiritual master is Krsna, and He is imparting this spiritual knowledge to Arjuna.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is from those who are fully in Krsna consciousness that one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature.</p>
<p>Otherwise, one's life will be misdirected.</p>
<p>By the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual position, his material body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes, but when he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental platform, having the scope for spiritual life.</p>
<p>Actually, the living entity is not the performer of different activities.</p>
<p>He is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material nature.</p>
<p>Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot understand in what position he is actually situated.</p>
<p>With the association of a bona fide spiritual master, he can see his real position, and, by such an understanding, he can become fixed in full Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>A man in Krsna consciousness is not controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>It has already been stated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered to Krsna is relieved from the activities of material nature.</p>
<p>Therefore for one who is able to see things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually ceases.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse, Arjuna's questions are very appropriate.</p>
<p>He wants to know the symptoms of a person who has already transcended the material modes.</p>
<p>He first inquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person.</p>
<p>How can one understand that he has already transcended the influence of the modes of material nature? The second question asks how he lives and what his activities are.</p>
<p>Are they regulated or nonregulated? Then Arjuna inquires of the means by which he can attain the transcendental nature.</p>
<p>That is very important.</p>
<p>Unless one knows the direct means by which one can be situated always transcendentally, there is no possibility of showing the symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: He who does not hate illumination, attachment and delusion when they are present, nor longs for them when they disappear; who is seated like one unconcerned, being situated beyond these material reactions of the modes of nature, who remains firm, knowing that the modes alone are active; who regards alike pleasure and pain, and looks on a clod, a stone and a piece of gold with an equal eye; who is wise and holds praise and blame to be the same; who is unchanged in honor and dishonor, who treats friend and foe alike, who has abandoned all fruitive undertakings--such a man is said to have transcended the modes of nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna submitted the three different questions, and the Lord answers them one after another.</p>
<p>In these verses, Krsna first indicates that a person transcendentally situated neither envies anyone nor hankers for anything.</p>
<p>When a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>When he is actually out of the body, then he is out of the clutches of the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>But as long as he is not out of the material body, he should be neutral.</p>
<p>He should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will automatically be forgotten.</p>
<p>When one is conscious of the material body, he acts only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to Krsna, sense gratification automatically stops.</p>
<p>One does not need this material body, and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body.</p>
<p>The qualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is aloof from such activities.</p>
<p>How does he become aloof? He does not desire to enjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it.</p>
<p>Thus transcendentally situated, the devotee becomes automatically free.</p>
<p>He need not try to become free from the influence of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>The next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person.</p>
<p>The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and dishonor offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by such false honor and dishonor.</p>
<p>He performs his duty in Krsna consciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him.</p>
<p>He accepts things that are favorable for his duty in Krsna consciousness, otherwise he has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or gold.</p>
<p>He takes everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of Krsna consciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy.</p>
<p>He is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material existence.</p>
<p>Social and political issues do not affect him because he knows the situation of temporary upheavals and disturbances.</p>
<p>He does not attempt anything for his own sake.</p>
<p>He can attempt anything for Krsna, but for his personal self he does not attain anything.</p>
<p>By such behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse is a reply to Arjuna's third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to Krsna activities.</p>
<p>Krsna activities are known as bhakti-yoga--always acting for Krsna.</p>
<p>This includes not only Krsna, but His different plenary expansions such as Rama and Narayana.</p>
<p>He has innumerable expansions.</p>
<p>One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of Krsna, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated.</p>
<p>One should also note that all the forms of Krsna are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal.</p>
<p>Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities.</p>
<p>So, if one engages himself in the service of Krsna or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily.</p>
<p>This is already explained in the Seventh Chapter.</p>
<p>One who surrenders unto Krsna at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>To be in Krsna consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of Krsna.</p>
<p>The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine.</p>
<p>Thus the living entity's spiritual position is as good as gold, as good as Krsna in quality.</p>
<p>The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there is no question of bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there.</p>
<p>Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there is no meaning to bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications.</p>
<p>Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination.</p>
<p>It is said in the Vedic literature: brahmaiva san brahmapyeti.</p>
<p>One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman.</p>
<p>This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman.</p>
<p>By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as individual soul.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness, and which is immortal, imperishable and eternal.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity, and happiness.</p>
<p>Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization.</p>
<p>Paramatma, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Therefore, both Paramatma and the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord impregnates the inferior material nature with the fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature.</p>
<p>When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme.</p>
<p>This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization.</p>
<p>At this stage the Brahman realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization.</p>
<p>If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Paramatma realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>There are many examples of this in Vedic literature.</p>
<p>The four Kumaras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional service.</p>
<p>One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling down.</p>
<p>In Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going farther, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear.</p>
<p>Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>In the Vedic language it is also said: raso vai sah; rasam hy evayam labdhvanandi bhavati.</p>
<p>&quot;When one understands the Personality of God, the reservoir of pleasure, Krsna, he actually becomes transcendentally blissful.&quot;</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him, there is an exchange of these six opulences.</p>
<p>The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king.</p>
<p>And so, eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, eternal life accompany devotional service.</p>
<p>Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or imperishability is included in devotional service.</p>
<p>This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service.</p>
<p>The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over the material world, and due to this he falls down.</p>
<p>In his constitutional position, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature, goodness, passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>Due to the association of these three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there.</p>
<p>By engagement in devotional service in full Krsna consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed.</p>
<p>Therefore the process of devotional service beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering--the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service--should be practiced in the association of devotees.</p>
<p>Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one's material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the Lord's transcendental loving service.</p>
<p>This method is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter.</p>
<p>Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees.</p>
<p>By following such a process one becomes completely detached from all material activities.</p>
<p>One who can thus situate himself in the brahmajyoti is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.</p>
