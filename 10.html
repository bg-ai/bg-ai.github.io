<p>sri bhagavan uvaca--the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; bhuyah--again; eva--certainly; maha-baho--O mighty-armed; srnu--just hear; me--My; paramam--supreme; vacah--information; yat--that which; te--to you; aham--I; priyamanaya--thinking you dear to Me; vaksyami--say; hita-kamyaya--for your benefit.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord said: My dear friend, mighty-armed Arjuna, listen again to My supreme word, which I shall impart to you for your benefit and which will give you great joy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word paramam is explained thus by Parasara Muni: one who is full in six opulences, who has full strength, full fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and renunciation, is paramam, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>While Krsna was present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences.</p>
<p>Therefore great sages like Parasara Muni have all accepted Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Now Krsna is instructing Arjuna in more confidential knowledge of His opulences and His work.</p>
<p>Previously, beginning with the Seventh Chapter, the Lord already explained His different energies and how they are acting.</p>
<p>Now in this chapter He explains His specific opulences to Arjuna.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter he has clearly explained His different energies to establish devotion in firm conviction.</p>
<p>Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and various opulences.</p>
<p>The more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in devotional service.</p>
<p>One should always hear about the Lord in the association of devotees; that will enhance one's devotional service.</p>
<p>Discourses in the society of devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to be in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Others cannot take part in such discourses.</p>
<p>The Lord clearly tells Arjuna that because he is very dear to Him, for his benefit such discourses are taking place.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin, for, in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Brahma-samhita, Lord Krsna is the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>No one is greater than Him; He is the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>Here it is also stated by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages.</p>
<p>Even the demigods and great sages cannot understand Krsna; they can understand neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such commonplace and yet wonderful activities.</p>
<p>One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand Krsna.</p>
<p>Even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand Krsna by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it is not possible to understand Krsna by such foolish speculation.</p>
<p>Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth, &quot;Here I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>I am the Supreme.&quot;</p>
<p>One should know this.</p>
<p>Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists.</p>
<p>We can actually understand Krsna, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>The impersonal Brahman can be conceived by persons who are already in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position.</p>
<p>Because most men cannot understand Krsna in His actual situation, out of His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators.</p>
<p>Yet despite the Supreme Lord's uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme.</p>
<p>Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is Krsna.</p>
<p>The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of Krsna, they can understand Krsna.</p>
<p>No one else can understand Him.</p>
<p>So even great sages agree: What is atma, what is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship.</p>

<p>sarva-papaih pramucyate</p>
<p>yah--anyone; mam--unto Me; ajam--unborn; anadim--without beginning; ca--also; vetti--knows; loka--the planets; mahesvaram--supreme master; asammudhah--without doubt; sah--he; martyesu--among those subject to death; sarva-papaih--from all sinful reactions; pramucyate--is delivered.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>He who knows Me as the unborn, as the beginningless, as the Supreme Lord of all the worlds--he, undeluded among men, is freed from all sins.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Seventh Chapter, those who are trying to elevate themselves to the platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men.</p>
<p>They are superior to millions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual realization, but out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual situation, one who can come to the understanding that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most successful spiritually realized person.</p>
<p>In that stage only, when one has fully understood Krsna's supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful reactions.</p>
<p>Here the word ajam, meaning unborn, should not be confused with the living entities, who are described in the Second Chapter as ajam.</p>
<p>The Lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material attachment.</p>
<p>The conditional souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not changeable.</p>
<p>Even when He comes to this material world, He comes as the same unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord, by His internal potency, is not under the inferior material energy, but is always in the superior energy.</p>
<p>He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation.</p>
<p>All the demigods were created within this material world, but as far as Krsna is concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore Krsna is different even from the great demigods like Brahma and Siva.</p>
<p>And because He is the creator of Brahma, Siva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all planets.</p>
<p>Sri Krsna is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone who knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reaction.</p>
<p>One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Only by devotional service can He be known and not by any other means, as stated in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>One should not try to understand Krsna as a human being.</p>
<p>As stated previously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being.</p>
<p>This is again expressed here in a different way.</p>
<p>A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all sinful reactions.</p>
<p>If Krsna is known as the son of Devaki, then how can He be unborn? That is also explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam: When He appeared before Devaki and Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.</p>
<p>Anything done under the direction of Krsna is transcendental.</p>
<p>It cannot be contaminated by the material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious.</p>
<p>The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in the material world.</p>
<p>Everything is inauspicious because the very material mask is inauspicious.</p>
<p>We simply imagine it to be auspicious.</p>
<p>Real auspiciousness depends on activities in Krsna consciousness in full devotion and service.</p>
<p>Therefore if we at all want our activities to he auspicious, then we should work under the directions of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita, or from a bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>Because the spiritual master is the representative of the Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way.</p>
<p>There is no contradiction in these three sources.</p>
<p>All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world.</p>
<p>The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called sannyasa.</p>
<p>Anyone acting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sannyasi and a yogi, and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sannyasi, or a pseudo-yogi.</p>

<p>Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness, truthfulness, self-control and calmness, pleasure and pain, birth, death, fear, fearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame and infamy are created by Me alone.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created by Krsna, and they are described here.</p>
<p>Intelligence refers to the power of analyzing things in proper perspective, and knowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is matter.</p>
<p>Ordinary knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only to matter, and it is not accepted here as knowledge.</p>
<p>Knowledge means knowing the distinction between spirit and matter.</p>
<p>In modern education there is no knowledge about the spirit; they are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily needs.</p>
<p>Therefore academic knowledge is not complete.</p>
<p>Asammohah, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is not hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely he becomes free from bewilderment.</p>
<p>Nothing should be accepted blindly; everything should be accepted with care and with caution.</p>
<p>Ksama, forgiveness, should be practiced, and one should excuse the minor offenses of others.</p>
<p>Satyam, truthfulness, means that facts should be presented as they are for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>Facts should not be misrepresented.</p>
<p>According to social conventions, it is said that one can speak the truth only when it is palatable to others.</p>
<p>But that is not truthfulness.</p>
<p>The truth should be spoken in a straight and forward way, so that others will understand actually what the facts are.</p>
<p>If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he is a thief, that is truth.</p>
<p>Although sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain from speaking it.</p>
<p>Truthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>That is the definition of truth.</p>
<p>Self-control means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal enjoyment.</p>
<p>There is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>Therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mind should not indulge in unnecessary thoughts; that is called samah, or calmness.</p>
<p>Nor should one spend one's time pondering over earning money.</p>
<p>That is a misuse of the thinking power.</p>
<p>The mind should be used to understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be presented authoritatively.</p>
<p>The power of thought should be developed in association with persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual masters and those whose thinking is highly developed.</p>
<p>Sukham, pleasure or happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of the spiritual knowledge of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>And similarly, that which is painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the cultivation of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Anything favorable for the development of Krsna consciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be rejected.</p>
<p>Bhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body.</p>
<p>As far as the soul is concerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the beginning of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Birth and death apply to one's embodiment in the material world.</p>
<p>Fear is due to worrying about the future.</p>
<p>A person in Krsna consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore his future is very bright.</p>
<p>Others, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no knowledge of what the next life holds.</p>
<p>So they are therefore in constant anxiety.</p>
<p>If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to understand Krsna and be situated always in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>In that way we will be free from all fear.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, it is stated that fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory energy, but those who are free from the illusory energy, those who are confident that they are not the material body, that they are spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are therefore engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Their future is very bright.</p>
<p>This fear is a condition of persons who are not in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Bhayam, fearlessness, is only possible for one in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Ahimsa, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will put others into misery or confusion.</p>
<p>Material activities that are promised by so many politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good results because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental vision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society.</p>
<p>Ahimsa means that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of the human body can be achieved.</p>
<p>The human body is meant for spiritual realization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end commit violence on the human body.</p>
<p>That which furthers the future spiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.</p>
<p>Samata, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion.</p>
<p>To be very much attached or to be very much detached is not the best.</p>
<p>This material world should be accepted without attachment or aversion.</p>
<p>Similarly, that which is favorable for prosecuting Krsna consciousness should be accepted; that which is unfavorable should be rejected.</p>
<p>That is called samata, equanimity.</p>
<p>A person in Krsna consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept unless it is useful in the prosecution of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Tustih, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and more material goods by unnecessary activity.</p>
<p>One should be satisfied with whatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called satisfaction.</p>
<p>Tapas means austerity or penance.</p>
<p>There are many rules and definitions in the Vedas which apply here, like rising early in the morning and taking a bath.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning, but whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month.</p>
<p>One may not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination to make advancement in the science of Krsna consciousness, he should accept such bodily troubles which are recommended.</p>
<p>However, one should not fast unnecessarily or against Vedic injunctions.</p>
<p>One should not fast for some political purpose; that is described in Bhagavad-gita as fasting in ignorance, and anything done in ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>Everything done in the mode of goodness does advance one, however, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>As far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings to some good cause.</p>
<p>And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in terms of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>That is not only a good cause, but it is the best cause.</p>
<p>Because Krsna is good, His cause is also good.</p>
<p>Thus charity should be given to a person who is engaged in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>According to Vedic literature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to the brahmanas.</p>
<p>This practice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic injunction.</p>
<p>But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>A brahmana is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding Brahman.</p>
<p>A brahma-jana is one who knows Brahman; he is called a brahmana.</p>
<p>Thus charity is offered to the brahmanas because since they are always engaged in higher spiritual service, they have no time to earn their livelihood.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to the renouncer of life, the sannyasi.</p>
<p>The sannyasis beg from door to door, not for money but for missionary purposes.</p>
<p>The system is that they go from door to door to awaken the householders from the slumber of ignorance.</p>
<p>Because the householders are engaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in life--awakening their Krsna consciousness--it is the business of the sannyasis to go as beggars to the householders and encourage them to be Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>As it is said in the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of life.</p>
<p>This knowledge and method is distributed by the sannyasis; hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the brahmanas, and similar good causes, not to any whimsical cause.</p>
<p>Yasah, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is famous when he is known as a great devotee.</p>
<p>That is real fame.</p>
<p>If one has become a great man in Krsna consciousness and it is known, then he is truly famous.</p>
<p>One who does not have such fame is infamous.</p>
<p>All these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in the society of the demigods.</p>
<p>There are many forms of humanity on other planets, and these qualities are there.</p>
<p>Now, for one who wants to advance in Krsna consciousness, Krsna creates all these qualities, but the person develops them himself from within.</p>
<p>One who engages in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Of whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is Krsna.</p>
<p>Nothing can manifest in this material world which is not in Krsna.</p>
<p>That is knowledge; although we know that things are differently situated, we should realize that everything flows from Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord is giving a genealogical synopsis of the universal population.</p>
<p>Brahma is the original creature born out of the energy of the Supreme Lord known as Hiranyagarbha.</p>
<p>And from Brahma all the seven great sages, and before them four other great sages, named Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, and Sanatkumara, and the Manus, are manifest.</p>
<p>All these twenty-five great sages are known as the patriarchs of the living entities all over the universe.</p>
<p>There are innumerable universes and innumerable planets within each universe, and each planet is full of population of different varieties.</p>
<p>All of them are born of these twenty-five patriarchs.</p>
<p>Brahma underwent penance for one thousand years of the demigods before he realized by the grace of Krsna how to create.</p>
<p>Then from Brahma, Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, and Sanatkumara came out, then Rudra, and then the seven sages, and in this way all the brahmanas and ksatriyas are born out of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Brahma is known as pitamaha, the grandfather, and Krsna is known as the prapita-maha, the father of the grandfather.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The highest summit of spiritual perfection is knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Unless one is firmly convinced of the different opulences of the Supreme Lord, he cannot engage in devotional service.</p>
<p>Generally people know that God is great, but they do not know in detail how God is great.</p>
<p>Here are the details.</p>
<p>If one knows factually how God is great, then naturally he becomes a surrendered soul and engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>When one factually knows the opulences of the Supreme, there is no alternative but to surrender to Him.</p>
<p>This factual knowledge can be known from the descriptions in Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita and similar literatures.</p>
<p>In the administration of this universe there are many demigods distributed throughout the planetary system, and the chief of them are Brahma, Lord Siva and the four great Kumaras and other patriarchs.</p>
<p>There are many forefathers of the population of the universe, and all of them are born of the Supreme Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the original forefather of all forefathers.</p>
<p>These are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>When one is firmly convinced of them, he accepts Krsna with great faith and without any doubt, and he engages in devotional service.</p>
<p>All this particular knowledge is required in order to increase one's interest in the loving devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>One should not neglect to understand fully how great Krsna is, for by knowing the greatness of Krsna one will be able to be fixed in sincere devotional service.</p>

<p>I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds.</p>
<p>Everything emanates from Me.</p>
<p>The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A learned scholar who has studied the Vedas perfectly and has information from authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply these teachings can understand that Krsna is the origin of everything in both the material and spiritual worlds, and because he knows this perfectly he becomes firmly fixed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He can never be deviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools.</p>
<p>All Vedic literature agrees that Krsna is the source of Brahma, Siva and all other demigods.</p>
<p>In the Atharva-veda it is said, &quot;yo brahmanam vidadhati: purvam yo vai vedams ca gapayati sma krsnah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was Krsna who in the beginning instructed Brahma in Vedic knowledge and who disseminated Vedic knowledge in the past.&quot;</p>
<p>Then again it is said, &quot;atha puruso ha vai narayano 'kamayata prajah srjeya ity upakramya.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then the Supreme Personality Narayana desired to create living entities.&quot;</p>
<p>Again it is said:</p>
<p>narayanad brahma jayate, narayanad prajapatih prajayate, narayanad indro jayate, narayanad astau vasavo jayante, narayanad ekadasa rudra jayante, narayanad dvadasadityah.</p>
<p>&quot;From Narayana, Brahma is born, and from Narayana, the patriarchs are also born.</p>
<p>From Narayana, Indra is born, from Narayana the eight Vasus are born, from Narayana the eleven Rudras are born, from Narayana the twelve Adityas are born.&quot;</p>
<p>It is said in the same Vedas: brahmanyo devaki-putrah: &quot;The son of Devaki, Krsna, is the Supreme Personality.&quot;</p>
<p>Then it is said:</p>
<p>eko vai narayana asin na brahma na isano napo nagni samau neme dyav-aprthivi na naksatrani na suryah sa ekaki na ramate tasya dhyanantah sthasya yatra chandogaih kriyamanastakadi-samjnaka stuti-stomah stomam ucyate.</p>
<p>&quot;In the beginning of the creation there was only the Supreme Personality Narayana.</p>
<p>There was no Brahma, no Siva, no fire, no moon, no stars in the sky, no sun.</p>
<p>There was only Krsna, who creates all and enjoys all.&quot;</p>
<p>In the many Puranas it is said that Lord Siva was born from the highest, the Supreme Lord Krsna, and the Vedas say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator of Brahma and Siva, who is to be worshiped.</p>
<p>In the Moksa-dharma Krsna also says, prajapatim ca rudram capy aham eva srjami vai tau hi mam na vijanito mama maya-vimohitau.</p>
<p>&quot;The patriarchs, Siva and others are created by Me, though they do not know that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory energy.&quot;</p>
<p>In Varaha Purana it is also said, narayanah paro devas tasmaj jatas caturmukhah tasmad rudro 'bhavad devah sa ca sarvajnatam gatah.</p>
<p>&quot;Narayana is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahma was born, from whom Siva was born.&quot;</p>
<p>Lord Krsna is the source of all generations, and He is called the most efficient cause of everything.</p>
<p>He says that because &quot;everything is born of Me, I am the original source of all.</p>
<p>Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.&quot;</p>
<p>There is no supreme controller other than Krsna.</p>
<p>One who understands Krsna in such a way from a bona fide spiritual master and from Vedic literature, who engages all his energy in Krsna consciousness, becomes a truly learned man.</p>
<p>In comparison to him, all others, who do not know Krsna properly, are but fools.</p>
<p>Only a fool would consider Krsna to be an ordinary man.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person should not be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and interpretations on Bhagavad-gita and proceed in Krsna consciousness with determination and firmness.</p>

<p>The thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are surrendered to Me, and they derive great satisfaction and bliss enlightening one another and conversing about Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Pure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage themselves fully in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Their minds cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of Krsna.</p>
<p>Their talks are solely on the transcendental subjects.</p>
<p>The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse specifically.</p>
<p>Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged in glorifying the pastimes of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in Krsna, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with other devotees.</p>
<p>In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of God.</p>
<p>Once situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity.</p>
<p>There are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service.</p>
<p>This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting, Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering.</p>
<p>The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which is called Goloka Vrndavana, the supreme planet of Krsna.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of Krsna and rests there.</p>
<p>Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on.</p>
<p>This plant of devotional service is fully described in the Caitanya-caritamrta.</p>
<p>It is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water.</p>
<p>In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Srimad-Bhagavatam is also full of such narration about the relationship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the Srimad-Bhagavatam is very dear to the devotees.</p>
<p>In this narration there is nothing about material activities, sense gratification or liberation.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His devotees is fully described.</p>
<p>Thus the realized souls in Krsna consciousness take continual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young boy and girl take pleasure in association.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the word buddhi-yogam is very significant.</p>
<p>We may remember that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of buddhi-yoga.</p>
<p>Now buddhi-yoga is explained.</p>
<p>Buddhi-yogam itself is action in Krsna consciousness; that is the highest intelligence.</p>
<p>Buddhi means intelligence, and yogam means mystic activities or mystic elevation.</p>
<p>When one tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to Krsna consciousness in devotional service, his action is called buddhi-yogam.</p>
<p>In other words, buddhi-yogam is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of progress is Krsna.</p>
<p>People do not know this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important.</p>
<p>One should know that the goal is Krsna, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.</p>
<p>When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities, he is acting in karma-yoga.</p>
<p>When he knows that the goal is Krsna, but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand Krsna, he is acting in jnana-yoga.</p>
<p>And when he knows the goal and seeks Krsna completely in Krsna consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or buddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga.</p>
<p>This complete yoga is the highest perfectional stage of life.</p>
<p>A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make progress, then Krsna from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to Him without difficulty.</p>
<p>The qualification is that a person always engage himself in Krsna consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of services.</p>
<p>He should perform some sort of work for Krsna, and that work should be with love.</p>
<p>If a devotee is intelligent enough, he will make progress on the path of self-realization.</p>
<p>If one is sincere and devoted to the activities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and ultimately attain to Him.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare thousands of people were following Him.</p>
<p>Prakasananda, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist.</p>
<p>Sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists.</p>
<p>Actually that is not the fact.</p>
<p>There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion, but even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by Krsna Himself within his heart.</p>
<p>So the sincere devotee engaged in Krsna consciousness cannot be without knowledge.</p>
<p>The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure knowledge.</p>
<p>For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.</p>
<p>The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible to understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort.</p>
<p>Man can go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand Krsna or the Supreme Truth.</p>
<p>Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, Krsna, pleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee.</p>
<p>The pure devotee always has Krsna within his heart; therefore he is just like the sun that dissipates the darkness of ignorance.</p>
<p>This is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by Krsna.</p>
<p>Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of births, one's heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare Krsna, the dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of Visnu can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argument.</p>
<p>The pure devotee does not have to worry about the necessities of life; he need not be anxious because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, for He is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee.</p>
<p>This is the essence of the Gita's teachings.</p>
<p>By studying Bhagavad-gita, one can become a completely surrendered soul to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service.</p>
<p>As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic endeavors.</p>

<p>Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person.</p>
<p>You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-pervading beauty.</p>
<p>All the great sages such as Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa proclaim this of You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the modern philosopher, for here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the individual soul.</p>
<p>Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-gita in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He at once boldly declares, &quot;You are Parambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.&quot;</p>
<p>And previously Krsna states that He is the originator of everything and everyone.</p>
<p>Every demigod and every human being is dependant on Him.</p>
<p>Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independant of the Supreme Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service.</p>
<p>This is already explained in the previous verse by the Lord.</p>
<p>Now by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction.</p>
<p>It is not because Krsna is an intimate friend of Arjuna that he is flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth.</p>
<p>Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot.</p>
<p>Each and every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.</p>
<p>In the Kena Upanisad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for everything, and Krsna has already explained that everything is resting on Him.</p>
<p>The Mundaka Upanisad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him.</p>
<p>This constant thinking of Krsna is smaranam, one of the methods of devotional service.</p>
<p>It is only by devotional service to Krsna that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body.</p>
<p>In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure.</p>
<p>One who understands that Krsna is the purest of the pure can become purified from all sinful activities.</p>
<p>One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Arjuna's acceptance of Krsna as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed by great personalities, of whom Narada is the chief.</p>
<p>Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon Him and enjoy one's transcendental relationship with Him.</p>
<p>He is the supreme existence.</p>
<p>He is free from bodily needs, birth and death.</p>
<p>Not only does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures, the Puranas and histories.</p>
<p>In all Vedic literatures Krsna is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, &quot;Although I am unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles.&quot;</p>
<p>He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him.</p>
<p>This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of Krsna.</p>
<p>If we want to understand Bhagavad-gita, we should accept the statements in these two verses.</p>
<p>This is called the parampara system, acceptance of the disciplic succession.</p>
<p>Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>It is not possible by so-called academic education.</p>
<p>Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Krsna is an ordinary person.</p>

<p>Arjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature cannot understand Krsna.</p>
<p>He is not even known by the demigods, so what to speak of the so-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is Krsna and that He is the perfect one.</p>
<p>One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna.</p>
<p>He received the authority of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>As described in the Fourth Chapter, the parampara system of disciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-gita was lost, and therefore Krsna reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to Gitopanisad, Bhagavad-gita should be understood in the parampara system.</p>
<p>When the parampara system was lost, Arjuna was again selected to rejuvenate it.</p>
<p>The acceptance of Arjuna of all that Krsna says should be emulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-gita, and then only can we understand that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord Krsna can be known by persons who are in a relationship with Him through the discharge of devotional service, like Arjuna and his successors.</p>
<p>Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know Krsna.</p>
<p>Mental speculation that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not know Krsna should not try to comment on Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita is the statement of Krsna, and since it is the science of Krsna, it should be understood from Krsna as Arjuna understood it.</p>
<p>It should not be received from atheistic persons.</p>
<p>The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized Paramatma and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>A liberated man and even a common man may realize impersonal Brahman or localized Paramatma, yet they may not understand God's personality from the verses of Bhagavad-gita, which are being spoken by this person, Krsna.</p>
<p>Sometimes the impersonalists accept Krsna as Bhagavan, or they accept His authority.</p>
<p>Yet many liberated persons cannot understand Krsna as Purusottama, the Supreme Person, the father of all living entities.</p>
<p>Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Purusottama.</p>
<p>And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as Bhutesa, the supreme controller of everyone.</p>
<p>And even if one knows Krsna as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Devadeva, the worshipful God of all demigods.</p>
<p>And even if one knows Him as the worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati.</p>
<p>Thus the truth about Krsna is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Krsna as He is.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse it appears that Arjuna is already satisfied with his understanding of the Supreme Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>By Krsna's grace, Arjuna has personal experience, intelligence and knowledge and whatever else a person may have through all these agencies, and he has understood Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>For him there is no doubt, Yet he is asking Krsna to explain His all-pervading nature so that in the future people will understand, especially the impersonalists, how He exists in His all-pervading aspect through His different energies.</p>
<p>One should know that this is being asked by Arjuna on behalf of the common people.</p>

<p>How should I meditate on You? In what various forms are You to be contemplated, O Blessed Lord?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is covered by His yoga-maya.</p>
<p>Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him.</p>
<p>Now Arjuna is convinced that His friend, Krsna, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by the common man.</p>
<p>No common man, including the demons and atheists, can know Krsna because He is guarded by His yoga-maya energy.</p>
<p>Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their benefit.</p>
<p>The superior devotee is not only concerned for his own understanding, but for the understanding of all mankind.</p>
<p>Out of his mercy, because he is a Vaisnava, a devotee, Arjuna is opening the understanding for the common man as far as the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme is concerned.</p>
<p>He addresses Krsna specifically as yogin because Sri Krsna is the master of the yoga-maya energy by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man.</p>
<p>The common man who has no love for Krsna cannot always think of Krsna; therefore he has to think materially.</p>
<p>Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this world.</p>
<p>Because materialists cannot understand Krsna spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how Krsna is manifested by physical representations.</p>

<p>Tell me again in detail, O Janardana [Krsna], of Your mighty potencies and glories, for I never tire of hearing Your ambrosial words.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A similar statement was made to Suta Gosvami by the rsis of Naimisaranya, headed by Saunaka.</p>
<p>That statement is:</p>
<p>vayam tu na vitrpyama uttama-sloka-vikrame yac chrnvatam rasa-jnanam svadu svadu pade pade.</p>
<p>&quot;One can never be satiated even though one continuously hears the transcendental pastimes of Krsna, who is glorified by Vedic hymns.</p>
<p>Those who have entered into a transcendental relationship with Krsna relish in every step descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus Arjuna is interested to hear about Krsna, specifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Now as far as amrtam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement concerning Krsna is just like nectar.</p>
<p>And this nectar can be perceived by practical experience.</p>
<p>Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories, but one never tires of hearing about Krsna.</p>
<p>It is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead.</p>
<p>For instance, the Puranas are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord.</p>
<p>In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: Yes, I will tell you of My splendorous manifestations, but only of those which are prominent, O Arjuna, for My opulence is limitless.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is not possible to comprehend the greatness of Krsna and His opulences.</p>
<p>The senses of the individual soul are imperfect and do not permit him to understand the totality of Krsna's affairs.</p>
<p>Still the devotees try to understand Krsna, but not on the principle that they will be able to understand Krsna fully at any specific time or in any state of life.</p>
<p>Rather, the very topics of Krsna are so relishable that they appear to them as nectar.</p>
<p>Thus they enjoy them.</p>
<p>In discussing Krsna's opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure.</p>
<p>Therefore they want to hear and discuss them.</p>
<p>Krsna knows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different energies.</p>
<p>The word pradhanyatah (principal) is very important because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His features are unlimited.</p>
<p>It is not possible to understand them all.</p>
<p>And vibhuti, as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole manifestation.</p>
<p>In the Amara-kosa dictionary it is stated that vibhuti indicates an exceptional opulence.</p>
<p>The impersonalist or the pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energy.</p>
<p>Both in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are distributed in every variety of manifestation.</p>
<p>Now Krsna is describing what can be directly perceived by the common man; thus part of His variegated energy is described in this way.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I am the Self, O Gudakesa, seated in the hearts of all creatures.</p>
<p>I am the beginning, the middle and the end of all beings.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse Arjuna is addressed as Gudakesa, which means one who has conquered the darkness of sleep.</p>
<p>For those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance, it is not possible to understand how the Supreme Godhead manifests Himself in the material and spiritual worlds.</p>
<p>Thus this address by Krsna to Arjuna is significant.</p>
<p>Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences.</p>
<p>Krsna first informs Arjuna that He is the Self or soul of the entire cosmic manifestation by dint of His primary expansion.</p>
<p>Before the material creation, the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the Purusa incarnations, and from Him everything begins.</p>
<p>Therefore He is atma, the soul of the mahat-tattva, the universal elements.</p>
<p>The total material energy is not the cause of the creation, but actually the Maha-Visnu enters into the mahat-tattva, the total material energy.</p>
<p>He is the soul.</p>
<p>When Maha-Visnu enters into the manifested universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity.</p>
<p>We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark.</p>
<p>Without the existence of the spiritual spark, the body cannot develop.</p>
<p>Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop unless the Supreme Soul of Krsna enters.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all manifested universes.</p>
<p>A description of the three purusa-avataras is given in Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>&quot;The Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests three features, as Karanodakasayi Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Ksirodakasayi Visnu, in this material manifestation.&quot;</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord Krsna, the cause of all causes, lies down in the cosmic ocean as Maha-Visnu or Karanodakasayi Visnu, and therefore Krsna is the beginning of this universe, the maintainer of the universal manifestation, and the end of all the energy.</p>

<p>There are twelve Adityas, of which Krsna is the principal.</p>
<p>And among all the luminaries twinkling in the sky, the sun is the chief, and in the Brahma-samhita the sun is accepted as the glowing effulgence of the Supreme Lord and is considered to be one of His eyes.</p>
<p>Marici is the controlling deity of the heavenly spaces.</p>

<p>Lord Ramacandra, of the Ramayana, an incarnation of Krsna, is the mightest of warriors.</p>

<p>Of all creations I am the beginning and the end and also the middle, O Arjuna.</p>
<p>Of all sciences I am the spiritual science of the Self, and among logicians I am the conclusive truth.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Among created manifestations, the total material elements are first created by Maha-Visnu and are annihilated by Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Brahma is the secondary creator.</p>
<p>All these created elements are different incarnations of the material qualities of the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the beginning, the middle and the end of all creation.</p>
<p>Regarding the spiritual science of the Self, there are many literatures, such as the four Vedas, the Vedanta-sutra and the Puranas, the Srimad-Bhagavatam and the Gita.</p>
<p>These are all representatives of Krsna.</p>
<p>Among logicians there are different stages of argument.</p>
<p>The presentation of evidence is called japa.</p>
<p>The attempt to defeat one another is called vitanda, and the final conclusion is called vada.</p>
<p>The conclusive truth, the end of all reasoning processes, is Krsna.</p>

<p>I am also inexhaustable time, and of creators I am Brahma, whose manifold faces turn everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Akara, the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, is the beginning of the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>Without akara, nothing can be sounded; therefore it is the beginning of sound.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit there are also many compound words, of which the dual word, like Rama-krsna, is called dvandvah.</p>
<p>For instance, Rama and Krsna have the same rhythm and therefore are called dual.</p>
<p>Among all kinds of killers, time is the ultimate because time kills everything.</p>
<p>Time is the representative of Krsna because in due course of time there will be a great fire and everything will be annihilated.</p>
<p>Among the creators and living entities, Brahma is the chief.</p>
<p>The various Brahmas exhibit four, eight, sixteen, etc., heads accordingly, and they are the chief creators in their respective universes.</p>
<p>The Brahmas are representatives of Krsna.</p>

<p>I am all-devouring death, and I am the generator of all things yet to be.</p>
<p>Among women I am fame, fortune, speech, memory, intelligence, faithfulness and patience.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As soon as a man is born, he dies at every moment.</p>
<p>Thus death is devouring every living entity at every moment, but the last stroke is called death itself.</p>
<p>That death is Krsna.</p>
<p>All species of life undergo six basic changes.</p>
<p>They are born, they grow, they remain for some time, they reproduce, they dwindle and finally vanish.</p>
<p>Of these changes, the first is deliverance from the womb, and that is Krsna.</p>
<p>The first generation is the beginning of all future activities.</p>
<p>The six opulences listed are considered to be feminine.</p>
<p>If a woman possesses all of them or some of them she becomes glorious.</p>
<p>Sanskrit is a perfect language and is therefore very glorious.</p>
<p>After studying, if one can remember the subject matter, he is gifted with good memory, or smrti One need not read many books on different subject matters; the ability to remember a few and quote them when necessary is also another opulence.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Of hymns I am the Brhat-sama sung to the Lord Indra, and of poetry I am the Gayatri verse, sung daily by brahmanas.</p>
<p>Of months I am November and December, and of seasons I am flower-bearing spring.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It has already been explained by the Lord that amongst all the Vedas, the Sama-veda is rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods.</p>
<p>One of these songs is the Brhat-sama, which has an exquisite melody and is sung at midnight.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter are not written whimsically, as in much modern poetry.</p>
<p>Amongst the regulated poetry, the Gayatri mantra, which is chanted by the duly qualified brahmanas, is the most prominent.</p>
<p>The Gayatri mantra is mentioned in the Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Because the Gayatri mantra is especially meant for God realization, it represents the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>This mantra is meant for spiritually advanced people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord.</p>
<p>One must first acquire the qualities of the perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness according to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the Gayatri mantra.</p>
<p>The Gayatri mantra is very important in Vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound incarnation of Brahman.</p>
<p>Brahma is its initiator, and it is passed down from him in disciplic succession.</p>
<p>The months of November and December are considered the best of all months because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time, and the people become very happy.</p>
<p>Of course spring is a season universally liked because it is neither too hot nor too cold, and the flowers and trees blossom and flourish.</p>
<p>In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating Krsna's pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and it is the representative of the Supreme Lord Krsna.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of cheaters all over the universe.</p>
<p>Of all cheating processes, gambling stands supreme and therefore represents Krsna.</p>
<p>As the Supreme, Krsna can be more deceitful than any mere man.</p>
<p>If Krsna chooses to deceive a person, no one can surpass Him in His deceit.</p>
<p>His greatness is not simply one-sided--it is all-sided.</p>
<p>Among the victorious, He is victory.</p>
<p>He is the splendor of the splendid.</p>
<p>Among enterprising industrialists, He is the most enterprising.</p>
<p>Among adventurers, He is the most adventurous, and among the strong, He is the strongest.</p>

<p>Even in His childhood He lifted Govardhana Hill.</p>
<p>No one can surpass Him in cheating, no one can surpass Him in splendor, no one can surpass Him in victory, no one can surpass Him in enterprise, and no one can surpass Him in strength.</p>

<p>Krsna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Vasudeva is the immediate expansion of Krsna.</p>
<p>Both Lord Krsna and Baladeva appear as the sons of Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Amongst the sons of Pandu, Arjuna is famous and valiant.</p>
<p>Indeed, he is the best of men and therefore represents Krsna.</p>
<p>Among the munis, or learned men conversant in Vedic knowledge, Vyasa is the greatest because he explained Vedic knowledge in many different ways for the understanding of the common mass of people in this age of Kali.</p>
<p>And Vyasa is also known as an incarnation of Krsna; therefore Vyasa also represents Krsna.</p>
<p>Kavis are those who are capable of thinking thoroughly on any subject matter.</p>
<p>Among the kavis, Usana was the spiritual master of the demons; he was extremely intelligent, far-seeing, political and spiritual in every way.</p>
<p>Thus Usana is another representative of the opulence of Krsna.</p>

<p>There are many suppressing agents, of which the most important are those that cut down the miscreants.</p>
<p>When miscreants are punished, the rod of chastisement represents Krsna.</p>
<p>Among those who are trying to be victorious in some field of activity, the most victorious element is morality.</p>
<p>Among the confidential activities of hearing, thinking and meditating, silence is most important because by silence one can make progress very quickly.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by His entering into all things as the Supersoul.</p>
<p>The Lord here tells Arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur.</p>
<p>He should know that all things are existing due to Krsna's entering them as Supersoul.</p>
<p>From Brahma, the most gigantic entity, on down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them.</p>
<p>Worship of demigods is discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like Brahma and Siva only represent part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him.</p>
<p>He is samata, which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him.</p>
<p>In the Visnu-mantra it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord Krsna in the same category with demigods--be they even Brahma or Siva--becomes at once an atheist.</p>
<p>If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of Krsna's energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord Sri Krsna and can fix his mind in the worship of Krsna without deviation.</p>
<p>The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is.</p>
<p>Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in Krsna consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position.</p>
<p>Devotional service and worship of Krsna are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses eight to eleven.</p>
<p>That is the way of pure devotional service.</p>
<p>How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter.</p>
