<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sanjaya said: Seeing Arjuna full of compassion and very sorrowful, his eyes brimming with tears, Madhusudana, Krsna, spoke the following words.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Material compassion, lamentation and tears are all signs of ignorance of the real self.</p>
<p>Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization.</p>
<p>The word &quot;Madhusudana&quot; is significant in this verse.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna killed the demon Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted Krsna to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty.</p>
<p>No one knows where compassion should be applied.</p>
<p>Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless.</p>
<p>A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress--the gross material body.</p>
<p>One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a sudra, or one who laments unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Arjuna was a ksatriya, and this conduct was not expected from him.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad-gita was sung by Him.</p>
<p>This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by the supreme authority, Lord Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>This realization is made possible by working with the fruitive being situated in the fixed conception of the real self.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Person [Bhagavan] said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life.</p>
<p>They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical.</p>
<p>Therefore Lord Krsna is referred to as &quot;Bhagavan&quot; throughout the Gita.</p>
<p>Bhagavan is the ultimate in the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Paramatma, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagavan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:</p>
<p>vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam yaj jnanam advayam brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate.</p>
<p>&quot;The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical.</p>
<p>Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan.&quot; (Bhag.1.2.11) These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun's surface and the sun planet itself.</p>
<p>One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student.</p>
<p>One who understands the sun's surface is further advanced.</p>
<p>And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest.</p>
<p>Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine--its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature--may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Paramatma feature of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Therefore, the bhaktas, or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagavan feature of the Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter.</p>
<p>The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word Bhagavan is explained by the great authority, Parasara Muni, the father of Vyasadeva.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagavan.</p>
<p>There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely.</p>
<p>Only Krsna can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>No living entity, including Brahma, Lord Siva, or Narayana, can possess opulences as fully as Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-samhita by Lord Brahma himself that Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>No one is equal to or above Him.</p>
<p>He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavan, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.</p>
<p>isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah anadir adir govindah sarua-karana-karanam</p>
<p>&quot;There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavan, but Krsna is the supreme because none can excel Him.</p>
<p>He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss.</p>
<p>He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes.&quot; (Brahma-samhita 5.1)</p>
<p>In the Bhagavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Krsna is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:</p>
<p>ete camsa-kalah pumsah krsnas tu bhagavan svayam indrari-vyakulam lokam mrdayanti yuge yuge</p>
<p>&quot;All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.&quot; (Bhag.1.3.28)</p>
<p>Therefore, Krsna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.</p>
<p>In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna's lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore Krsna expressed His surprise with the word kutas, &quot;wherefrom.&quot;</p>
<p>Such unmanly sentiments were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as Aryans.</p>
<p>The word aryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization.</p>
<p>Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Visnu, or Bhagavan, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is.</p>
<p>Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-Aryans.</p>
<p>Although Arjuna was a ksatriya, he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight.</p>
<p>This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-Aryans.</p>
<p>Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen.</p>

<p>O son of Prtha, do not yield to this degrading impotence.</p>
<p>It does not become you.</p>
<p>Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O chastiser of the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna was addressed as the &quot;son of Prtha,&quot; who happened to be the sister of Krsna's father Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with Krsna.</p>
<p>If the son of a ksatriya declines to fight, he is a ksatriya in name only, and if the son of a brahmana acts impiously, he is a brahmana in name only.</p>
<p>Such ksatriyas and brahmanas are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore, Krsna did not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a ksatriya.</p>
<p>Arjuna was the most intimate friend of Krsna, and Krsna was directly guiding him on the chariot; but in spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle, he would be committing an infamous act; therefore Krsna said that such an attitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality.</p>
<p>Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bhisma and his relatives, but Krsna considered that sort of magnanimity not approved by authority.</p>
<p>Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called nonviolence should be given up by persons like Arjuna under the direct guidance of Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna said: O killer of Madhu [Krsna], how can I counterattack with arrows in battle men like Bhisma and Drona, who are worthy of my worship?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Respectable superiors like Bhisma the grandfather and Dronacarya the teacher are always worshipable.</p>
<p>Even if they attack, they should not be counterattacked.</p>
<p>It is general etiquette that superiors are not to be offered even a verbal fight.</p>
<p>Even if they are sometimes harsh in behavior, they should not be harshly treated.</p>
<p>Then, how is it possible for Arjuna to counterattack them? Would Krsna ever attack His own grandfather, Ugrasena, or His teacher, Sandipani Muni? These were some of the arguments by Arjuna to Krsna.</p>

<p>It is better to live in this world by begging than to live at the cost of the lives of great souls who are my teachers.</p>
<p>Even though they are avaricious, they are nonetheless superiors.</p>
<p>If they are killed, our spoils will be tainted with blood.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to scriptural codes, a teacher who engages in an abominable action and has lost his sense of discrimination is fit to be abandoned.</p>
<p>Bhisma and Drona were obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because of his financial assistance, although they should not have accepted such a position simply on financial considerations.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, they have lost the respectability of teachers.</p>
<p>But Arjuna thinks that nevertheless they remain his superiors, and therefore to enjoy material profits after killing them would mean to enjoy spoils tainted with blood.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Nor do we know which is better--conquering them or being conquered by them.</p>
<p>The sons of Dhrtarastra, whom if we killed we should not care to live, are now standing before us on this battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary violence, although fighting is the duty of the ksatriyas, or whether he should refrain and live by begging.</p>
<p>If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only means of subsistence.</p>
<p>Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side might emerge victorious.</p>
<p>Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was justified), still, if the sons of Dhrtarastra died in battle, it would be very difficult to live in their absence.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, that would be another kind of defeat for them.</p>
<p>All these considerations by Arjuna definitely prove that he was not only a great devotee of the Lord but that he was also highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses.</p>
<p>His desire to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign of detachment.</p>
<p>He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his faith in the words of instruction of Sri Krsna (his spiritual master), indicate.</p>
<p>It is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation.</p>
<p>Unless the senses are controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation.</p>
<p>Arjuna was competent in all these attributes, over and above his enormous attributes in his material relationships.</p>

<p>Please instruct me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By nature's own way the complete system of material activities is a source of perplexity for everyone.</p>
<p>In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life.</p>
<p>All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life which happen without our desire.</p>
<p>They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone.</p>
<p>Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion.</p>
<p>No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed.</p>
<p>The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession.</p>
<p>A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything.</p>
<p>One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master.</p>
<p>This is the purport of this verse.</p>
<p>Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the problems of life.</p>
<p>In the Garga Upanisad the perplexed man is described as follows:</p>
<p>yo va etad aksaram gargy aviditvasmal lokat praiti sa krpanah</p>
<p>&quot;He is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science of self-realization.&quot;</p>
<p>This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity who can ultilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is the brahmana, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life.</p>
<p>The krpanas, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life.</p>
<p>One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of &quot;skin disease.&quot;</p>
<p>The krpana thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or the krpana thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death.</p>
<p>Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals who take care of children also.</p>
<p>Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes ot his perplexities.</p>
<p>Although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties.</p>
<p>He is therefore asking Lord Krsna, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution.</p>
<p>He offers himself to Krsna as a disciple.</p>
<p>He wants to stop friendly talks.</p>
<p>Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master.</p>
<p>Krsna is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-gita, and Arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the Gita.</p>
<p>How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-gita is stated in the Gita itself.</p>
<p>And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to Krsna as a person, but to &quot;the unborn within Krsna.&quot;</p>
<p>There is no difference between Krsna's within and without.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses.</p>
<p>I will not be able to destroy it even if I win an unrivalled kingdom on the earth with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was unable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>He could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in solving the problems of life; help can only be given by a spiritual master like Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent Krsna conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the problems of life.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya said that one who is master in the science of Krsna consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual master.</p>
<p>kibavipra, kiba nyasi, sudra kene naya yei krsna-tattva-vetta, sei 'guru' haya. (Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya 8.128)</p>
<p>&quot;It does not matter whether a person is a vipra [learned scholar in Vedic wisdom] or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life--if he is master in the science of Krsna, he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual master.&quot;</p>
<p>So without being a master in the science of Krsna consciousness, no one is a bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>It is also said in Vedic literatures:</p>
<p>sat-karma-nipuno vipro mantra-tantra-visaradah avaisnavo gurur na syad vaisnavah svapaco guruh</p>
<p>&quot;A scholarly brahmana, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a Vaisnava, or expert in the science of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a Vaisnava, or Krsna conscious.&quot;</p>
<p>The problems of material existence--birth, old age, disease and death--cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development.</p>
<p>In many parts of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life, which are full of wealth, and economically developed, yet the problems of material existence are still present.</p>
<p>They are seeking peace in different ways, but they ean achieve real happiness only if they consult Krsna, or the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam--which constitute the science of Krsna--or the bona fide representative of Krsna, the man in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>If economic development and material comforts could drive away one's lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivalled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would not be able to drive away his lamentations.</p>
<p>He sought, therefore, refuge in Krsna consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony.</p>
<p>Economic development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature.</p>
<p>Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking a place on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gita confirms this: ksine punye martyalokam visanti &quot;When the results of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life.&quot;</p>
<p>Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way.</p>
<p>Such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter of Krsna, as Arjuna is seeking to do.</p>
<p>So Arjuna asked Krsna to solve his problem definitely, and that is the way of Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus, Arjuna, chastiser of enemies, told Krsna, &quot;Govinda, I shall not fight,&quot; and fell silent.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Dhrtarastra must have been very glad to understand that Arjuna was not going to fight and was instead leaving the battlefield for the begging profession.</p>
<p>But Sanjaya disappointed him again in relating that Arjuna was competent to kill his enemies (parantapah).</p>
<p>Although Arjuna was for the time being overwhelmed with false grief due to family affection, he surrendered unto Krsna, the supreme spiritual master, as a disciple.</p>
<p>This indicated that he would soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of self-realization, or Krsna consciousness, and would then surely fight.</p>
<p>Thus Dhrtarastra's joy would be frustrated, since Arjuna would be enlightened by Krsna and would fight to the end.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O descendant of Bharata, at that time Krsna, smiling, in the midst of both the armies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The talk was going on between intimate friends, namely the Hrsikesa and the Gudakesa.</p>
<p>As friends, both of them were on the same level, but one of them voluntarily became a student of the other.</p>
<p>Krsna was smiling because a friend had chosen to become a disciple.</p>
<p>As Lord of all, He is always in the superior position as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord accepts one who wishes to be a friend, a son, a lover or a devotee, or who wants Him in such a role.</p>
<p>But when He was accepted as the master, He at once assumed the role and talked with the disciple like the master--with gravity, as it is required.</p>
<p>It appears that the talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the presence of both armies so that all were benefitted.</p>
<p>So the talks of Bhagavad-gita are not for any particular person, society, or community, but they are for all, and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them.</p>

<p>The Lord at once took the position of the teacher and chastised the student, calling him, indirectly, a fool.</p>
<p>The Lord said, you are talking like a learned man, but you do not know that one who is learned--one who knows what is body and what is soul--does not lament for any stage of the body, neither in the living nor in the dead condition.</p>
<p>As it will be explained in later chapters, it will be clear that knowledge means to know matter and spirit and the controller of both.</p>
<p>Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than religious formularies.</p>
<p>And, because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man.</p>
<p>As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation.</p>
<p>The body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul.</p>
<p>One who knows this is actually learned, and for him there is no cause for lamentation, regardless of the condition of the material body.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Vedas, in the Katha Upanisad as well as in the Svetasvatara Upanisad, it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the maintainer of innumerable living entities, in terms of their different situations according to individual work and reaction of work.</p>
<p>That Supreme Personality of Godhead is also, by His plenary portions, alive in the heart of every living entity.</p>
<p>Only saintly persons who can see, within and without, the same Supreme Lord, can actually attain to perfect and eternal peace.</p>
<p>nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman tam atmastham ye 'nupasyanti dhiras tesam santih sasvati netaresam. (Katha 2.2.13)</p>
<p>The same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the world who pose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of knowledge.</p>
<p>The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna, and all the kings who are assembled on the battlefield, are eternally individual beings and that the Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their conditioned as well as in their liberated situations.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord's eternal associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual, eternal persons.</p>
<p>It is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons.</p>
<p>Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of maya or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord Krsna, the supreme authority.</p>
<p>Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein.</p>
<p>Krsna clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the Upanisads, will continue eternally.</p>
<p>This statement of Krsna is authoritative because Krsna cannot be subject to illusion.</p>
<p>If individuality is not a fact, then Krsna would not have stressed it so much--even for the future.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi may argue that the individuality spoken of by Krsna is not spiritual, but material.</p>
<p>Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish Krsna's individuality? Krsna affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also.</p>
<p>He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him.</p>
<p>Krsna has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-gita has no value as authoritative scripture.</p>
<p>A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing.</p>
<p>The Gita is above such literature.</p>
<p>No mundane book compares with the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>When one accepts Krsna as an ordinary man, the Gita loses all importance.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body.</p>
<p>But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned.</p>
<p>After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for Krsna to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great acaryas like Sri Ramanuja and others.</p>
<p>It is clearly mentioned in many places in the Gita that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord.</p>
<p>Those who are envious of Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature.</p>
<p>The nondevotee's approach to the teachings of the Gita is something like bees licking on a bottle of honey.</p>
<p>One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mysticism of the Bhagavad-gita can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book.</p>
<p>Nor can the Gita be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Mayavadi explanation of the Gita is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the Mayavadis and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the Mayavadi philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the Gita.</p>
<p>If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord.</p>
<p>The plurality of the individual soul and of the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed by the Vedas as above mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.</p>
<p>The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, and sometimes as an old man.</p>
<p>Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change.</p>
<p>This individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth--either material or spiritual--there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bhisma nor for Drona, for whom he was so much concerned.</p>
<p>Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy.</p>
<p>Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one's work in life.</p>
<p>So Bhisma and Drona, being noble souls, were surely going to have either spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence.</p>
<p>So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.</p>
<p>Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the Supersoul, and nature--both material and spiritual--is called a dhira or a most sober man.</p>
<p>Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained on the ground that spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion.</p>
<p>Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul being unchangeable.</p>
<p>As confirmed in the Gita, the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally (sanatana) and are called ksara; that is, they have a tendency to fall down into material nature.</p>
<p>These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after liberation, the individual soul remains the same--fragmental.</p>
<p>But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the Paramatma, who is different from the individual living entity.</p>
<p>When the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also.</p>
<p>The stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter.</p>
<p>If Arjuna is on the same level with Krsna, and Krsna is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless.</p>
<p>If both of them are deluded by the illusory energy (maya), then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other the instructed.</p>
<p>Such instruction would be useless because, in the clutches of maya, no one can be an authoritative instructor.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord Krsna is the Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgotten soul deluded by maya.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the proper discharge of duty, one has to learn to tolerate nonpermanent appearances and disappearances of happiness and distress.</p>
<p>According to Vedic injunction, one has to take his bath early in the morning even during the month of Magha (January-February).</p>
<p>It is very cold at that time, but in spite of that a man who abides by the religious principles does not hesitate to take his bath.</p>
<p>Similarly, a woman does not hesitate to cook in the kitchen in the months of May and June, the hottest part of the summer season.</p>
<p>One has to execute his duty in spite of climatic inconveniences.</p>
<p>Similarly, to fight is the religious principle of the ksatriyas, and although one has to fight with some friend or relative, one should not deviate from his prescribed duty.</p>
<p>One has to follow the prescribed rules and regulations of religious principles in order to rise up to the platform of knowledge because by knowledge and devotion only can one liberate himself from the clutches of maya (illusion).</p>
<p>The two different names of address given to Arjuna are also significant.</p>
<p>To address him as Kaunteya signifies his great blood relations from his mother's side; and to address him as Bharata signifies his greatness from his father's side.</p>
<p>From both sides he is supposed to have a great heritage.</p>
<p>A great heritage brings responsibility in the matter of proper discharge of duties; therefore, he cannot avoid fighting.</p>

<p>Anyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of spiritual realization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and happiness is certainly a person eligible for liberation.</p>
<p>In the varnasrama institution, the fourth stage of life, namely the renounced order (sannyasa) is a painstaking situation.</p>
<p>But one who is serious about making his life perfect surely adopts the sannyasa order of life in spite of all difficulties.</p>
<p>The difficulties usually arise from having to sever family relationships, to give up the connection of wife and children.</p>
<p>But if anyone is able to tolerate such difficulties, surely his path to spiritual realization is complete.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Arjuna's discharge of duties as a ksatriya, he is advised to persevere, even if it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved persons.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya took sannyasa at the age of twenty-four, and His dependants, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after them.</p>
<p>Yet for a higher cause He took sannyasa and was steady in the discharge of higher duties.</p>

<p>There is no endurance of the changing body.</p>
<p>That the body is changing every moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body.</p>
<p>But the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all changes of the body and the mind.</p>
<p>That is the difference between matter and spirit.</p>
<p>By nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal.</p>
<p>This conclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist and personalist.</p>
<p>In the Visnu Purana it is stated that Visnu and His abodes all have self-illuminated spiritual existence.</p>
<p>&quot;Jyotimsi visnur bhavanani visnuh.&quot;</p>
<p>The words existent and nonexistent refer only to spirit and matter.</p>
<p>That is the version of all seers of truth.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities who are bewildered by the influence of ignorance.</p>
<p>Removal of ignorance involves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper and the worshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference between the part and parcel living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One can understand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study of oneself, the difference between oneself and the Supreme being understood as the relationship between the part and the whole.</p>
<p>In the Vedanta-sutras, as well as in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, the Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all emanations.</p>
<p>Such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural sequences.</p>
<p>The living entities belong to the superior nature, as it will be revealed in the Seventh Chapter.</p>
<p>Although there is no difference between the energy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and energy or nature is accepted as the subordinate.</p>
<p>The living entities, therefore, are always subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the servant, or the teacher and the taught.</p>
<p>Such clear knowledge is impossible to understand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the Lord teaches the Bhagavad-gita for the enlightenment of all living entities for all time.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Know that which pervades the entire body is indestructible.</p>
<p>No one is able to destroy the imperishable soul.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread all over the body.</p>
<p>Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness.</p>
<p>Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole.</p>
<p>This spreading of consciousness is limited within one's own body.</p>
<p>The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another.</p>
<p>Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul's presence is perceived as individual consciousness.</p>
<p>This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size.</p>
<p>The Svetasvatara Upanisad confirms this:</p>
<p>balagra-sata-bhagasya satadha kalpitasya ca Bhag.jivah sa vijneyah sa canantyaya kalpate.</p>
<p>&quot;When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.&quot; (Svet.5.9)</p>
<p>Similarly, in the Bhagavatam the same version is stated:</p>
<p>kesagra-sata-bhagasya satamsah sadrsatmakah jivah suksma-svarupo 'yam sankhyatito hi cit-kanah</p>
<p>&quot;There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable.</p>
<p>This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body.</p>
<p>This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul.</p>
<p>Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration.</p>
<p>Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul.</p>
<p>In the Mundaka Upanisad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:</p>
<p>eso 'nuratma cetasa veditavyo yasmin pranah pancadha samvivesa pranais cittam sarvam otam prajanam yasmin visuddhe vibhavaty esa atma.</p>
<p>&quot;The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence.</p>
<p>This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air [prana, apana, vyana, samana and udana], is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities.</p>
<p>When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited.&quot; (Mund.3.1.9)</p>
<p>The hatha-yoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures--not for any material profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the material atmosphere.</p>
<p>So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man.</p>
<p>Only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading Visnu-tattva.</p>
<p>The influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body.</p>
<p>According to the Mundaka Upanisad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul.</p>
<p>The individual atomic soul is definitely there in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body.</p>
<p>The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul.</p>
<p>When the soul passes away from this position, activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases.</p>
<p>Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul.</p>
<p>Medical science, however, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.</p>
<p>Such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine molecules.</p>
<p>In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules.</p>
<p>Similarly, the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the Supreme Lord, called by the name prabha or superior energy.</p>
<p>Neither Vedic knowledge nor modern science denies the existence of the spirit soul in the body, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the Bhagavad-gita by the Personality of Godhead Himself.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The material body is perishable by nature.</p>
<p>It may perish immediately, or it may do so after a hundred years.</p>
<p>It is a question of time only.</p>
<p>There is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely.</p>
<p>But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension.</p>
<p>So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation because the living entity can neither be killed as he is, nor can the material body, which cannot be saved for any length of time, be permanently protected.</p>
<p>The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized.</p>
<p>In the Vedanta-sutras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light.</p>
<p>As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the light of the soul maintains this material body.</p>
<p>As soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body.</p>
<p>The body itself is unimportant.</p>
<p>Arjuna was advised to fight and sacrifice the material body for the cause of religion.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>For the soul there is never birth nor death.</p>
<p>Nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be.</p>
<p>He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval.</p>
<p>He is not slain when the body is slain.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one with the Supreme.</p>
<p>He undergoes no changes like the body.</p>
<p>Sometimes the soul is called the steady, or kutastha.</p>
<p>The body is subject to six kinds of transformations.</p>
<p>It takes its birth in the womb of the mother's body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion.</p>
<p>The soul, however, does not go through such changes.</p>
<p>The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth.</p>
<p>The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die.</p>
<p>Anything which has birth also has death.</p>
<p>And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future.</p>
<p>He is eternal, ever-existing, and primeval--that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being.</p>
<p>Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul.</p>
<p>The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does.</p>
<p>The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth.</p>
<p>The changes of the body do not affect the soul.</p>
<p>The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material.</p>
<p>The soul has no by-product either.</p>
<p>The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man.</p>
<p>The body develops because of the soul's presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change.</p>
<p>Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.</p>
<p>In the Katha Upanisad also we find a similar passage which reads:</p>
<p>na jayate mriyate va vipascin nayam kutascin na vibhuva kascit ajo nityah sasvato 'yam purano na hanyate hanyamane sarire. (Katha 1.2.18)</p>
<p>The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-gita, but here in this verse there is one special word, vipascit, which means learned or with knowledge.</p>
<p>The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness.</p>
<p>Therefore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul.</p>
<p>Even if one does not find the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness.</p>
<p>Sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime.</p>
<p>As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky.</p>
<p>Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all bodies--whether man or animal--we can understand the presence of the soul.</p>
<p>This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge--past, present and future.</p>
<p>The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful.</p>
<p>When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of Krsna.</p>
<p>But Krsna is not like the forgetful soul.</p>
<p>If so, Krsna's teachings of Bhagavad-gita would be useless.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of souls--namely the minute particle soul (anu-atma) and the Supersoul (the vibhu-atma).</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in the Katha Upanisad in this way:</p>
<p>anor aniyan mahato mahiyan atmasya jantor nihito guhayam tam akratuh pasyati vita-soko dhatuh prasadan mahimanam atmanah (Katha 1.2.20)</p>
<p>&quot;Both the Supersoul [Paramatma] and the atomic soul [jivatma] are situated on the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can, by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul.&quot;</p>
<p>Krsna is the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore he requires to be enlightened by Krsna, or by His bona fide representative (the spiritual master).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Partha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible, unborn, eternal and immutable, kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Everything has its proper utility, and a man who is situated in complete knowledge knows how and where to apply a thing for its proper utility.</p>
<p>Similarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with the person in knowledge.</p>
<p>Although the justice of the peace awards capital punishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be blamed because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of justice.</p>
<p>In Manu-samhita, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the king's punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial.</p>
<p>Similarly, when Krsna orders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and, as such, Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of fighting for Krsna, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted.</p>
<p>A surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him.</p>
<p>Therefore the fighting to be executed by Arjuna at the instruction of Krsna is with full knowledge, so there is no possibility of sinful reaction.</p>

<p>As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, similarly, the soul accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Change of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact.</p>
<p>Even some of the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age.</p>
<p>From old age, the change is transferred to another body.</p>
<p>This has already been explained in the previous verse.</p>
<p>Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another.</p>
<p>The Vedas, like the Mundaka Upanisad, as well as the Svetasvatara Upanisad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree.</p>
<p>One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (Krsna) is simply watching His friend.</p>
<p>Of these two birds--although they are the same in quality--one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend.</p>
<p>Krsna is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird.</p>
<p>Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant.</p>
<p>Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one's changing his position from one tree to another or from one body to another.</p>
<p>The jiva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master--as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto Krsna for instruction--the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations.</p>
<p>Both the Katha Upanisad and Svetasvatara Upanisad confirm this:</p>
<p>samane vrkse puruso nimagno 'nisaya socati muhyamanah justam yada pasyaty anyam isam asya mahimanam iti vita-sokah</p>
<p>&quot;Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree.</p>
<p>But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the Lord and knows His glories--at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.&quot;</p>
<p>Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, Krsna, and is understanding the Bhagavad-gita from Him.</p>
<p>And thus, hearing from Krsna, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.</p>
<p>Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher.</p>
<p>He should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities.</p>
<p>One who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life.</p>
<p>So there was no cause for Arjuna's lamentation.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can he be burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>All kinds of weapons, swords, flames, rains, tornadoes, etc., are unable to kill the spirit soul.</p>
<p>It appears that there were many kinds of weapons made of earth, water, air, ether, etc., in addition to the modern weapons of fire.</p>
<p>Even the nuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons, but formerly there were other weapons made of all different types of material elements.</p>
<p>Firearms were counteracted by water weapons, which are now unknown to modern science.</p>
<p>Nor do modern scientists have knowledge of tornado weapons.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the soul can never be cut into pieces, nor annihilated by any number of weapons, regardless of scientific devices.</p>
<p>Nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Soul.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi, however, cannot describe how the individual soul evolved from ignorance and consequently became covered by illusory energy.</p>
<p>Because they are atomic individual souls (sanatana) eternally, they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of the fire, although one in quality with the fire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire.</p>
<p>In the Varaha Purana, the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme.</p>
<p>They are eternally so, according to the Bhagavad-gita also.</p>
<p>So, even after being liberated from illusion, the living entity remains a separate identity, as is evident from the teachings of the Lord to Arjuna.</p>
<p>Arjuna became liberated by the knowledge received from Krsna, but he never became one with Krsna.</p>

<p>This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried.</p>
<p>He is everlasting, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>All these qualifications of the atomic soul definitely prove that the individual soul is eternally the atomic particle of the spirit whole, and he remains the same atom eternally, without change.</p>
<p>The theory of monism is very difficult to apply in this case, because the individual soul is never expected to become one homogeneously.</p>
<p>After liberation from material contamination, the atomic soul may prefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the intelligent souls enter into the spiritual planets to associate with the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The word sarva-gatah (all-pervading) is significant because there is no doubt that living entities are all over God's creation.</p>
<p>They live on the land, in the water, in the air, within the earth and even within fire.</p>
<p>The belief that they are sterilized in fire is not acceptable, because it is clearly stated here that the soul cannot be burned by fire.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no doubt that there are living entities also in the sun planet with suitable bodies to live there.</p>
<p>If the sun is uninhabited, then the word sarva-gatah--living everywhere--becomes meaningless.</p>

<p>It is said that the soul is invisible, inconceivable, immutable, and unchangeable.</p>
<p>Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As described previously, the magnitude of the soul is so small for our material calculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope; therefore, he is invisible.</p>
<p>As far as the soul's existence is concerned, no one can establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof of sruti or Vedic wisdom.</p>
<p>We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception.</p>
<p>There are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority.</p>
<p>No one can deny the existence of his father, based upon the authority of his mother.</p>
<p>There is no other source of understanding the identity of the father except by the authority of the mother.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is no other source of understanding the soul except by studying the Vedas.</p>
<p>In other words, the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge.</p>
<p>The soul is consciousness and conscious--that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have to accept that.</p>
<p>Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul.</p>
<p>As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal.</p>
<p>Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This concept is repeated in the Vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the conception of the soul.</p>
<p>Repetition of something is necessary in order that we understand the matter thoroughly without error.</p>

<p>If, however, you think that the soul is perpetually born and always dies, still you have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, who do not believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body.</p>
<p>When Lord Krsna spoke the Bhagavad-gita, it appears that such philosophers existed, and they were known as the Lokayatikas and Vaibhasikas.</p>
<p>These philosophers maintained that life symptoms, or soul, takes place at a certain mature condition of material combination.</p>
<p>The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly.</p>
<p>According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements.</p>
<p>The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy.</p>
<p>Currently, many pseudo-religions--now becoming fashionable in America--are also adhering to this philosophy, as well as to the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.</p>
<p>Even if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul--as in the Vaibhasika philosophy--there would still have been no cause for lamentation.</p>
<p>No one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in modern science and scientific warfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy.</p>
<p>According to the Vaibhasika philosophy, the so-called soul or atma vanishes along with the deterioration of the body.</p>
<p>So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul, or whether he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament.</p>
<p>According to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to grieve for such an incidence.</p>
<p>However, since he was not risking rebirth of the soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected with sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Krsna sarcastically addressed Arjuna as maha-bahu, mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the Vaibhasikas, which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom.</p>
<p>As a ksatriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles.</p>

<p>And, after finishing one term of activities, one has to die to take birth for the next.</p>
<p>In this way the cycle of birth and death is revolving, one after the other without liberation.</p>
<p>This cycle of birth and death does not, however, support unnecessary murder, slaughter and war.</p>
<p>But at the same time, violence and war are inevitable factors in human society for keeping law and order.</p>
<p>The Battle of Kuruksetra, being the will of the Supreme, was an inevitable event, and to fight for the right cause is the duty of a ksatriya.</p>
<p>Why should he be afraid of or aggrieved at the death of his relatives since he was discharging his proper duty? He did not deserve to break the law, thereby becoming subjected to the reactions of sinful acts, of which he was so afraid.</p>
<p>By avoiding the discharge of his proper duty, he would not be able to stop the death of his relatives, and he would be degraded due to his selection of the wrong path of action.</p>

<p>avyaktadini--in the beginning unmanifested; bhutani--all that are created; vyakta--manifested; madhyani--in the middle; bharata--O descendant of Bharata; avyakta--nonmanifested; nidhanani--all that are vanquished; eva--it is all like that; tatra--therefore; ka--what; paridevana--lamentation.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim state, and unmanifest again when they are annihilated.</p>
<p>So what need is there for lamentation?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Accepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the existence of soul and the other not believing in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation in either case.</p>
<p>Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom.</p>
<p>Yet even if, for argument's sake, we accept the atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation.</p>
<p>Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation.</p>
<p>From this subtle state of unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested.</p>
<p>From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth.</p>
<p>When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage.</p>
<p>The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested--that is the difference.</p>
<p>Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost.</p>
<p>Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference.</p>
<p>And if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-gita (antavanta ime dehah) that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time (nityasyoktah saririnah) but that soul is eternal, then we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul.</p>
<p>It is something like a dream.</p>
<p>In a dream we may think of flying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot.</p>
<p>The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body.</p>
<p>Therefore, in either case, whether one believes in the existence of the soul, or one does not believe in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the body.</p>

<p>Since Gitopanisad is largely based on the principles of the Upanisads, it is not surprising to also find this passage in the Katha Upanisad.</p>
<p>sravanayapi bahubhir yo na labhyah srnvanto 'pi bahavo yah na vidyuh ascaryo vakta kusalo 'sya labdha ascaryo jnata kusalanusistah.</p>
<p>The fact that the atomic soul is within the body of a gigantic animal, in the body of a gigantic banyan tree, and also in the microbic germs, millions and billions of which occupy only an inch of space, is certainly very amazing.</p>
<p>Men with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to Brahma, the first living being in the universe.</p>
<p>Owing to a gross material conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small.</p>
<p>So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description.</p>
<p>Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence.</p>
<p>Perhaps one has no idea that one must think of the soul, and also make a solution of the material miseries.</p>
<p>Some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the position of the soul, the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective functions, relationships and all other major and minor details.</p>
<p>And it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects.</p>
<p>But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul, then one's life is successful.</p>
<p>The easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the statements of the Bhagavad-gita spoken by the greatest authority, Lord Krsna, without being deviated by other theories.</p>
<p>But it also requires a great deal of penance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one is able to accept Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Krsna can, however, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no other way.</p>

<p>The Lord now concludes the chapter of instruction on the immutable spirit soul.</p>
<p>In describing the immortal soul in various ways, Lord Krsna establishes that the soul is immortal and the body is temporary.</p>
<p>Therefore Arjuna as a ksatriya should not abandon his duty out of fear that his grandfather and teacher--Bhisma and Drona--will die in the battle.</p>
<p>On the authority of Sri Krsna, one has to believe that there is a soul different from the material body, not that there is no such thing as soul, or that living symptoms develop at a certain stage of material maturity resulting from the interaction of chemicals.</p>
<p>Though the soul is immortal, violence is not encouraged, but at the time of war it is not discouraged when there is actual need for it.</p>
<p>That need must be justified in terms of the sanction of the Lord, and not capriciously.</p>

<p>Considering your specific duty as a ksatriya, you should know that there is no better engagement for you than fighting on religious principles; and so there is no need for hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Out of the four orders of social administration, the second order, for the matter of good administration, is called ksatriya.</p>
<p>Ksat means hurt.</p>
<p>One who gives protection from harm is called ksatriya (trayate--to give protection).</p>
<p>The ksatriyas are trained for killing in the forest.</p>
<p>A ksatriya would go into the forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his sword.</p>
<p>When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of cremation.</p>
<p>This system is being followed even up to the present day by the ksatriya kings of Jaipur state.</p>
<p>The ksatriyas are specially trained for challenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor.</p>
<p>Therefore, ksatriyas are never meant for accepting directly the order of sannyasa or renunciation.</p>
<p>Nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is never a factor or principle.</p>
<p>In the religious law books it is stated:</p>
<p>ahavesu mitho 'nyonyam jighamsanto mahiksitah yuddhamanah param saktya svargam yanty aparanmukhah yajnesu pasavo brahman hanyante satatam dvijaih samskrtah kila mantrais ca te 'pi svargam avapnuvan.</p>
<p>&quot;In the battlefield, a king or ksatriya, while fighting another king envious of him, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the brahmanas also attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial fire.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore, killing on the battle on the religious principle and the killing of animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts of violence, because everyone is benefitted by the religious principles involved.</p>
<p>The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the ksatriyas killed in the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the brahmanas who attain them by offering sacrifice.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of svadharmas, specific duties.</p>
<p>As long as one is not liberated, one has to perform the duties of that particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation.</p>
<p>When one is liberated, one's svadharma--specific duty--becomes spiritual and is not in the material bodily concept.</p>
<p>In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the brahmanas and ksatriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable.</p>
<p>Svadharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth Chapter.</p>
<p>On the bodily plane svadharma is called varnasrama-dharma, or man's steppingstone for spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>Human civilization begins from the stage of varnasrama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of nature of the body obtained.</p>
<p>Discharging one's specific duty in any field of action in accordance with varnasrama-dharma serves to elevate one to a higher status of life.</p>

<p>As supreme teacher of the world, Lord Krsna condemns the attitude of Arjuna who said, &quot;I do not find any good in this fighting.</p>
<p>It will cause perpetual habitation in hell.&quot;</p>
<p>Such statements by Arjuna were due to ignorance only.</p>
<p>He wanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his specific duty.</p>
<p>For a ksatriya to be in the battlefield and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of fools.</p>
<p>In the Parasara-smrti or religious codes made by Parasara, the great sage and father of Vyasadeva, it is stated:</p>
<p>ksatriyo hi praja raksan sastra-panih pradandayan nirjitya parasainyadi ksitim dharmena palayet.</p>
<p>&quot;The ksatriya's duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties, and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and order.</p>
<p>Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus, with religious principles, he should rule over the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting.</p>
<p>If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets whose doors were wide open to him.</p>
<p>Fighting would be for his benefit in either case.</p>

<p>Lord Krsna now directly says that Arjuna should fight for the sake of fighting because He desires the battle.</p>
<p>There is no consideration of happiness or distress, profit or gain, victory or defeat in the activities of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>That everything should be performed for the sake of Krsna is transcendental consciousness; so there is no reaction to material activities.</p>
<p>He who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness or in passion, is subject to the reaction, good or bad.</p>
<p>But he who has completely surrendered himself in the activities of Krsna consciousness is no longer obliged to anyone, nor is he a debtor to anyone, as one is in the ordinary course of activities.</p>
<p>It is said:</p>
<p>devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam pitrnam na kinkaro nayamrni ca rajan sarvatmana yah saranam saranyam gato mukundam parihrtya kartam (Bhag.11.5.41)</p>

<p>That is the indirect hint given by Krsna to Arjuna in this verse, and the matter will be more clearly explained in the following verses.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#239" id="239">2.39</a></h3>

<p>Thus far I have declared to you the analytical knowledge of sankhya philosophy.</p>
<p>Now listen to the knowledge of yoga whereby one works without fruitive result.</p>
<p>O son of Prtha, when you act by such intelligence, you can free yourself from the bondage of works.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, sankhya means that which describes phenomena in detail, and sankhya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul.</p>
<p>And yoga involves controlling the senses.</p>
<p>Arjuna's proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification.</p>
<p>Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom by conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dhrtarastra.</p>
<p>In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification, for there is a sacrifice of wisdom and duty.</p>
<p>Krsna, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally, and we simply change our bodily dress in different manners.</p>
<p>But, actually, we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress.</p>
<p>An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as sankhya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary.</p>
<p>This sankhya has nothing to do with the sankhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila.</p>
<p>Long before the imposter Kapila's sankhya, the sankhya philosophy was expounded in the Srimad-Bhagavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Krsna, who explained it to His mother, Devahuti.</p>
<p>It is clearly explained by Him that the Purusa, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prakrti.</p>
<p>This is accepted in the Vedas and in the Gita.</p>
<p>The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prakrti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individuals souls.</p>
<p>All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers.</p>
<p>This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord.</p>
<p>This is the last snare of maya or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto Vasudeva, Lord Krsna, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.</p>
<p>Arjuna has already accepted Krsna as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: sisyas te 'ham sadhi mam tvam prapannam.</p>
<p>Consequently, Krsna will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord.</p>
<p>This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Paramatma in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>But such communion does not take place without devotional service.</p>
<p>One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in Krsna consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love.</p>
<p>In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Thus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word sankhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic sankhya-yoga enunciated by the impostor Kapila.</p>
<p>One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the sankhya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic sankhya.</p>
<p>Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord Krsna care to mention such godless philosophical speculations.</p>
<p>Real sankhya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, but even that sankhya has nothing to do with the current topics.</p>
<p>Here, sankhya means analytical description of the body and the soul.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Therefore, Lord Krsna's sankhya and Lord Kapila's sankhya, as described in the Bhagavatam; are one and the same.</p>
<p>They are all bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>He said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between sankhya-yoga and bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Of course, atheistic sankhya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic sankhya-yoga is referred to in the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in Krsna consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service.</p>
<p>One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss.</p>
<p>By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental qualities automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge.</p>
<p>There is much difference between work in Krsna consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness.</p>
<p>Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Activity in Krsna consciousness, or acting for the benefit of Krsna without expectation of sense gratification, is the highest transcendental quality of work.</p>
<p>Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage.</p>
<p>Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure.</p>
<p>But any work begun in Krsna consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished.</p>
<p>The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in Krsna consciousness is incomplete.</p>
<p>One percent done in Krsna consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent; whereas, in material activity, without a hundred percent success, there is no profit.</p>
<p>Ajamila performed his duty in some percentage of Krsna consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the Lord.</p>
<p>There is a nice verse in this connection in Srimad-Bhagavatam:</p>
<p>tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam harer bhajan na pakko 'tha patet tato yadi yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim ko vartha apto 'bhajatam sva-dharmatah</p>
<p>&quot;If someone gives up self-gratificatory pursuits and works in Krsna consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what loss is there on his part? And, what can one gain if one performs his material activities perfectly?&quot; (Bhag.1.5.17) Or, as the Christians say, &quot;What profiteth a man if he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul?&quot;</p>
<p>Material activities and their results end with the body.</p>
<p>But work in Krsna consciousness carries the person again to Krsna consciousness, even after the loss of the body.</p>
<p>At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured brahmana or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation.</p>
<p>That is the unique quality of work done in Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one.</p>
<p>O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many-branched.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A strong faith in Krsna consciousness that one should be elevated to the highest perfection of life is called vyavasayatmika intelligence.</p>
<p>The Caitanya-caritamrta [Cc.Madhya 22.62] states:</p>
<p>'sraddha'-sabde visvasa kahe sudrdha niscaya krsne bhakti kaile sarva-karma krta haya</p>
<p>Faith means unflinching trust in something sublime.</p>
<p>When one is engaged in the duties of Krsna consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations to family traditions, humanity, or nationality.</p>
<p>Fruitive activities are the engagements of one's reactions from past good or bad deeds.</p>
<p>When one is awake in Krsna consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities.</p>
<p>When one is situated in Krsna consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad.</p>
<p>The highest perfection of Krsna consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life.</p>
<p>This state is automatically achieved by progressive Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The resolute purpose of a person in Krsna consciousness is based on knowledge (&quot;Vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah&quot;) by which one comes to know perfectly that Vasudeva, or Krsna, is the root of all manifested causes.</p>
<p>As water on the root of a tree is automatically distributed to the leaves and branches, in Krsna consciousness, one can render the highest service to everyone--namely self, family, society, country, humanity, etc.</p>
<p>If Krsna is satisfied by one's actions, then everyone will be satisfied.</p>
<p>Service in Krsna consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of Krsna, who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>As such, to be well-versed in Krsna consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of Krsna, and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one's mission in life.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows:</p>
<p>yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado yasyaprasadanna gatih kuto 'pi dhyayam stuvams tasya yasas tri-sandhyam vande guroh sri-caranaravindam.</p>
<p>&quot;By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied.</p>
<p>And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.&quot;</p>
<p>The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the body--not theoretically but practically, when there is no longer chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities.</p>
<p>One who is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth.</p>
<p>Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>People in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karma-kanda portions of the Vedas.</p>
<p>They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common.</p>
<p>In the Vedas many sacrifices are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the jyotistoma sacrifices.</p>
<p>In fact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, similarly unenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.</p>
<p>In the karma-kanda section of the Vedas it is said that those who perform the four monthly penances become eligible to drink the somarasa beverages to become immortal and happy forever.</p>
<p>Even on this earth some are very eager to have somarasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratifications.</p>
<p>Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices.</p>
<p>They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life.</p>
<p>It is understood that there are gardens called nandana-kanana in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of somarasa wine.</p>
<p>Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world.</p>

<p>Be transcendental to all of them.</p>
<p>Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world.</p>
<p>The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane.</p>
<p>Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the Supreme Transcendence.</p>
<p>All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence.</p>
<p>For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement.</p>
<p>When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata.</p>
<p>The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.</p>
<p>As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes.</p>
<p>One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss.</p>
<p>This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependant on the good will of Krsna</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>All purposes that are served by the small pond can at once be served by the great reservoirs of water.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be served to one who knows the purpose behind them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-kanda division of the Vedic literature are to encourage gradual development of self-realization.</p>
<p>And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord Krsna, the primeval cause of everything.</p>
<p>So, self-realization means understanding Krsna and one's eternal relationship with Him.</p>
<p>The relationship of the living entities with Krsna is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The living entities are parts and parcels of Krsna; therefore, revival of Krsna consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.33.7) as follows:</p>
<p>aho bata svapaco'to gariyan yaj-jihvagre vartate nama tubhyam tepus tapas te juhuvuh sasnur arya brahmanucur nama grnanti ye te.</p>
<p>&quot;O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a candala [dog eater], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization.</p>
<p>Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Such a person is considered to be the best of the Aryan family.&quot;</p>
<p>So one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas, without being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification.</p>
<p>It is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals and the injunctions of the Vedantas and the Upanisads.</p>
<p>It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas.</p>
<p>This is hardly possible in this age.</p>
<p>The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls.</p>
<p>When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prakasananda Sarasvati, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Vedanta philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master found Him to be a great fool, and thus he asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman.</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand Vedanta philosophy; the best purpose of Vedanta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Vedanta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the Vedanta philosophy is Lord Krsna; and the highest Vedantist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action.</p>
<p>Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are three considerations here: prescribed duties, capricious work, and inaction.</p>
<p>Prescribed duties refer to activities performed while one is in the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Capricious work means actions without the sanction of authority, and inaction means not performing one's prescribed duties.</p>
<p>The Lord advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty without being attached to the result.</p>
<p>One who is attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action.</p>
<p>Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the result of such actions.</p>
<p>As far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities.</p>
<p>Routine work, in terms of the scriptural injunctions, is done without desire for results.</p>
<p>As one has to do it, obligatory work is action in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Work with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not auspicious.</p>
<p>Everyone has his proprietory right in regard to prescribed duties, but should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.</p>
<p>Arjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty without attachment to the result.</p>
<p>His nonparticipation in the battle is another side of attachment.</p>
<p>Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation.</p>
<p>Any attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage.</p>
<p>Inaction is sinful.</p>
<p>Therefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of salvation for Arjuna.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna tells Arjuna that he should act in yoga.</p>
<p>And what is that yoga? Yoga means to concentrate the mind upon the Supreme by controlling the ever-disturbing senses.</p>
<p>And who is the Supreme? The Supreme is the Lord.</p>
<p>And because He Himself is telling Arjuna to fight, Arjuna has nothing to do with the results of the fight.</p>
<p>Gain or victory are Krsna's concern; Arjuna is simply advised to act according to the dictation of Krsna.</p>
<p>The following of Krsna's dictation is real yoga, and this is practiced in the process called Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>By Krsna consciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship.</p>
<p>One has to become the servant of Krsna, or the servant of the servant of Krsna.</p>
<p>That is the right way to discharge duty in Krsna consciousness, which alone can help one to act in yoga.</p>
<p>Arjuna is a ksatriya, and as such he is participating in the varnasrama-dharma institution.</p>
<p>It is said in the Visnu Purana that in the varnasrama-dharma, the whole aim is to satisfy Visnu.</p>
<p>No one should satisfy himself, as is the rule in the material world, but one should satisfy Krsna.</p>
<p>So, unless one satisfies Krsna, one cannot correctly observe the principles of varnasrama-dharma.</p>
<p>Indirectly, Arjuna was advised to act as Krsna told him.</p>

<p>But one who understands his real constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus knows the position of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the Vaikuntha planets, where there is neither material, miserable life, nor the influence of time and death.</p>
<p>To know one's constitutional position means to know also the sublime position of the Lord.</p>
<p>One who wrongly thinks that the living entity's position and the Lord's position are on the same level is to be understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>He becomes a lord himself and thus paves the way for the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>But one who, understanding that his position is to serve, transfers himself to the service of the Lord, at once becomes eligible for Vaikunthaloka.</p>
<p>Service for the cause of the Lord is called karma-yoga or buddhi-yoga, or in plain words, devotional service to the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion, you shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many good examples in the lives of the great devotees of the Lord of those who became indifferent to the rituals of the Vedas simply by devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>When a person factually understands Krsna and his relationship with Krsna, he naturally becomes completely indifferent to the rituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced brahmana.</p>
<p>Sri Madhavendra Puri, a great devotee and acarya in the line of the devotees, says:</p>
<p>sandhya-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bhoh snana tubhyam namo bho devah pitaras ca tarpana-vidhau naham ksamah ksamyatam yatra kvapi nisadya yadava-kulottamasya kamsa-dvisah smaram smaram agham harami tad alam manye kim anyena me.</p>
<p>&quot;O Lord, in my prayers three times a day, all glory to You.</p>
<p>Bathing, I offer my obeisances unto You.</p>
<p>O demigods! O forefathers! Please excuse me for my inability to offer you my respects.</p>
<p>Now wherever I sit, I can remember the great descendant of the Yadu dynasty [Krsna], the enemy of Kamsa, and thereby I can free myself from all sinful bondage.</p>
<p>I think this is sufficient for me.&quot;</p>
<p>The Vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes: comprehending all kinds of prayer three times a day, taking a bath early in the morning, offering respects to the forefathers, etc.</p>
<p>But, when one is fully in Krsna consciousness and is engaged in His transcendental loving service, one becomes indifferent to all these regulative principles because he has already attained perfection.</p>
<p>If one can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord Krsna, he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacrifices as recommended in revealed scriptures.</p>
<p>And, similarly, if one has not understood that the purpose of the Vedas is to reach Krsna and simply engages in the rituals, etc., then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements.</p>
<p>Persons in Krsna consciousness transcend the limit of sabda-brahma, or the range of the Vedas and Upanisads.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>To say that one is in samadhi is to say that one has fully realized Krsna consciousness; that is, one in full samadhi has realized Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan.</p>
<p>The highest perfection of self-realization is to understand that one is eternally the servitor of Krsna and that one's only business is to discharge one's duties in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person, or unflinching devotee of the Lord, should not be disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas nor be engaged in fruitive activities for promotion to the heavenly kingdom.</p>
<p>In Krsna consciousness, one comes directly into communion with Krsna, and thus all directions from Krsna may be understood in that transcendental state.</p>
<p>One is sure to achieve results by such activities and attain conclusive knowledge.</p>
<p>One has only to carry out the orders of Krsna or His representative, the spiritual master.</p>

<p>As there are symptoms for each and every man, in terms of his particular situation, similarly one who is Krsna conscious has his particular nature--talking, walking, thinking, feeling, etc.</p>
<p>As a rich man has his symptoms by which he is known as a rich man, as a diseased man has his symptoms, by which he is known as diseased, or as a learned man has his symptoms, so a man in transcendental consciousness of Krsna has specific symptoms in various dealings.</p>
<p>One can know his specific symptoms from the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Most important is how the man in Krsna consciousness speaks, for speech is the most important quality of any man.</p>
<p>It is said that a fool is undiscovered as long as he does not speak, and certainly a well-dressed fool cannot be identified unless he speaks, but as soon as he speaks, he reveals himself at once.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Bhagavatam affirms that any person who is fully in Krsna consciousness, or devotional service of the Lord, has all the good qualities of the great sages, whereas a person who is not so transcendentally situated has no good qualifications, because he is sure to be taking refuge in his own mental concoctions.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all kinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction.</p>
<p>Artificially, such sense desires cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>But if one is engaged in Krsna consciousness, then, automatically, sense desires subside without extraneous efforts.</p>
<p>Therefore, one has to engage himself in Krsna consciousness without hesitation, for this devotional service will instantly help one on to the platform of transcendental consciousness.</p>
<p>The highly developed soul always remains satisfied in himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Such a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from petty materialism; rather, he remains always happy in his natural position of eternally serving the Supreme Lord.</p>

<p>The word muni means one who can agitate his mind in various ways for mental speculation without coming to a factual conclusion.</p>
<p>It is said that every muni has a different angle of vision, and unless a muni differs from other munis, he cannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term.</p>
<p>Nasau munir yasya matam na binnam.</p>
<p>But a sthita-dhi-muni as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinary muni The sthita-dhi-muni is always in Krsna consciousness, for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation.</p>
<p>He has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord Sri Krsna, or Vasudeva, is everything.</p>
<p>He is called a muni fixed in mind.</p>
<p>Such a fully Krsna conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest.</p>
<p>Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord's grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord.</p>
<p>And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion.</p>
<p>Attachment means accepting things for one's own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment.</p>
<p>But one fixed in Krsna consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person is always steady in his determination.</p>

<p>The test of a yogi, devotee, or self-realized soul is that he is able to control the senses according to his plan.</p>
<p>Most people, however, are servants of the senses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses.</p>
<p>That is the answer to the question as to how the yogi is situated.</p>
<p>The senses are compared to venomous serpents.</p>
<p>They want to act very loosely and without restriction.</p>
<p>The yogi, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents--like a snake charmer.</p>
<p>He never allows them to act independantly.</p>
<p>There are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not's, and some of them are do's.</p>
<p>Unless one is able to follow the do's and the do-not's, restricting oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The best example, set herein, is the tortoise.</p>
<p>The tortoise can at any moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes.</p>
<p>Similarly, the senses of the Krsna conscious persons are used only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are withdrawn otherwise.</p>
<p>Keeping the senses always in the service of the Lord is the example set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the senses within.</p>

<p>The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of eatables.</p>
<p>The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions, nor loses his taste for eatables.</p>
<p>Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like astanga-yoga, in the matter of yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no better knowledge.</p>
<p>But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord Krsna, in the course of his advancement in Krsna consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead material things.</p>
<p>Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good if one actually has a taste for Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many learned sages, philosophers and transcendentalists who try to conquer the senses, but in spite of their endeavors, even the greatest of them sometimes fall victim to material sense enjoyment due to the agitated mind.</p>
<p>Even Visvamitra, a great sage and perfect yogi, was misled by Menaka into sex enjoyment, although the yogi was endeavoring for sense control with severe types of penance and yoga practice.</p>
<p>And,of course, there are so many similar instances in the history of the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind and the senses without being fully Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>Without engaging the mind in Krsna, one cannot cease such material engagements.</p>
<p>A practical example is given by Sri Yamunacarya, a great saint and devotee, who says: &quot;Since my mind has been engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, and I have been enjoying an ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life with a woman, my face at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought.&quot;</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically material enjoyment becomes distasteful.</p>
<p>It is as if a hungry man had satisfied his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa also conquered a great yogi, Durvasa Muni, simply because his mind was engaged in Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>That the highest conception of yoga perfection is Krsna consciousness is clearly explained in this verse.</p>
<p>And, unless one is Krsna conscious, it is not at all possible to control the senses.</p>
<p>As cited above, the great sage Durvasa Muni picked a quarrel with Maharaja Ambarisa, and Durvasa Muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the King, although not as powerful a yogi as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage's injustices and thereby emerged victorious.</p>
<p>The King was able to control his senses because of the following qualifications, as mentioned in the Srimad-Bhagavatam:</p>
<p>sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayor vacamsi vaikuntha-gunanavarnane karau harer mandira-marjanadisu srutim cakaracyuta-sat-kathodaye</p>

<p>padau hareh ksetra-padanusarpane siro hrsikesa-padabhivandane kamam ca dasye na tu kama-kamyaya yathottamasloka-janasraya ratih</p>
<p>&quot;King Ambarisa fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, engaged his words in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the form of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in smelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, his tongue in tasting the tulasi leaves offered to Him, his legs in traveling to the holy place where His temple is situated, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the Lord ... and all these qualifications made him fit to become a mat-parah devotee of the Lord.&quot; (Bhag.9.4.18-20)</p>
<p>The word mat-parah is most significant in this connection.</p>
<p>How one can become a mat-parah is described in the life of Maharaja Ambarisa.</p>
<p>Srila Baladeva Vidyabhusana, a great scholar and acarya in the line of the mat-parah, remarks: &quot;mad-bhakti-prabhavena sarvendriya-vijaya-purvika svatma drstih sulabheti bhavah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of devotional service to Krsna.&quot;</p>
<p>Also the example of fire is sometimes given: &quot;As the small flames within burn everything within the room, similarly Lord Visnu, situated in the heart of the yogi, burns up all kinds of impurities.&quot;</p>
<p>The Yoga-sutra also prescribes meditation on Visnu, and not meditation on the void.</p>
<p>The so-called yogis who meditate on something which is not the Visnu form simply waste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria.</p>
<p>We have to be Krsna conscious--devoted to the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the aim of the real yoga.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who is not Krsna conscious is subjected to material desires while contemplating the objects of senses.</p>
<p>The senses require real engagements, and if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will certainly seek engagement in the service of materialism.</p>
<p>In the material world everyone, including Lord Siva and Lord Brahma--to say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets--is subjected to the influence of sense objects, and the only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>Lord Siva was deep in meditation, but when Parvati agitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result Kartikeya was born.</p>
<p>When Haridasa Thakur was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarnation of Maya Devi, but Haridasa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>As illustrated in the above-mentioned verse of Sri Yamunacarya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of the Lord.</p>
<p>That is the secret of success.</p>
<p>One who is not, therefore, in Krsna consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by artificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By development of Krsna consciousness one can know that everything has its use in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Those who are without knowledge of Krsna consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a result, although they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not attain to the perfect stage of renunciation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a person in Krsna consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he does not become a victim of material consciousness.</p>
<p>For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat.</p>
<p>Whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that Krsna is the supreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion.</p>
<p>So, after offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called prasadam.</p>
<p>Thus everything becomes spiritualized and there is no danger of a downfall.</p>
<p>The devotee takes prasadam in Krsna consciousness, whereas the nondevotee rejects it as material.</p>
<p>The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence.</p>
<p>It is said that such a soul, even though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down again due to his not having support in devotional service.</p>

<p>The Krsna conscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of Krsna, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment.</p>
<p>If Krsna wants, the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and if Krsna does not want, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction.</p>
<p>Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the direction of Krsna.</p>
<p>This consciousness is the causeless mercy of the Lord, which the devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached to the sensual platform.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who is not in transcendental consciousness can have neither a controlled mind nor steady intelligence, without which there is no possibility of peace.</p>
<p>And how can there be any happiness without peace?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Unless one is in Krsna consciousness, there is no possibility of peace.</p>
<p>So it is confirmed in the Fifth Chapter (5.29) that when one understands that Krsna is the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance, and that He is the proprietor of all universal manifestations, that He is the real friend of all living entities, then only can one have real peace.</p>
<p>Therefore, if one is not in Krsna consciousness, there cannot be a final goal for the mind.</p>
<p>Disturbance is due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one is certain that Krsna is the enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and everything, then one can, with a steady mind, bring about peace.</p>
<p>Therefore, one who is engaged without a relationship with Krsna is certainly always in distress and is without peace, however much one may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is a self-manifested peaceful condition which can be achieved only in relationship with Krsna.</p>

<p>Unless all of the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord, even one of them engaged in sense gratification can deviate the devotee from the path of transcendental advancement.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the life of Maharaja Ambarisa, all of the senses must be engaged in Krsna consciousness, for that is the correct technique for controlling the mind.</p>

<p>What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are two classes of intelligent men.</p>
<p>The one is intelligent in material activities for sense gratification, and the other is introspective and awake to the cultivation of self-realization.</p>
<p>Activities of the introspective sage, or thoughtful man, are night for persons materially absorbed.</p>
<p>Materialistic persons remain asleep in such a night due to their ignorance of self-realization.</p>
<p>The introspective sage remains alert in the &quot;night&quot; of the materialistic men.</p>
<p>The sage feels transcendental pleasure in the gradual advancement of spiritual culture, whereas the man in materialistic activities, being asleep to self-realization, dreams of varieties of sense pleasure, feeling sometimes happy and sometimes distressed in his sleeping condition.</p>
<p>The introspective man is always indifferent to materialistic happiness and distress.</p>
<p>He goes on with his self-realization activities undisturbed by material reaction.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires--that enter like rivers into the ocean which is ever being filled but is always still--can alone achieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although the vast ocean is always filled with water, it is always, especially during the rainy season, being filled with much more water.</p>
<p>But the ocean remains the same--steady; it is not agitated, nor does it cross beyond the limit of its brink.</p>
<p>That is also true of a person fixed in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>As long as one has the material body, the demands of the body for sense gratification will continue.</p>
<p>The devotee, however, is not disturbed by such desires because of his fullness.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious man is not in need of anything because the Lord fulfills all his material necessities.</p>
<p>Therefore he is like the ocean--always full in himself.</p>
<p>Desires may come to him like the waters of the rivers that flow into the ocean, but he is steady in his activities, and he is not even slightly disturbed by desires for sense gratification.</p>
<p>That is the proof of a Krsna conscious man--one who has lost all inclinations for material sense gratification, although the desires are present.</p>
<p>Because he remains satisfied in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he can remain steady, like the ocean, and therefore enjoy full peace.</p>
<p>Others, however, who fulfill desires even up to the limit of liberation, what to speak of material success, never attain peace.</p>
<p>The fruitive workers, the salvationists, and also the yogis who are after mystic powers, are all unhappy because of unfulfilled desires.</p>
<p>But the person in Krsna consciousness is happy in the service of the Lord, and he has no desires to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>In fact, he does not even desire liberation from the so-called material bondage.</p>
<p>The devotees of Krsna have no material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego--he alone can attain real peace.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification.</p>
<p>In other words, desire for becoming Krsna conscious is actually desirelessness.</p>
<p>To understand one's actual position as the eternal servitor of Krsna, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because Krsna is the proprietor of everything, therefore everything must be used for the satisfaction of Krsna.</p>
<p>Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully Krsna conscious he fought because Krsna wanted him to fight.</p>
<p>For himself there was no desire to fight, but for Krsna the same Arjuna fought to his best ability.</p>
<p>Desire for the satisfaction of Krsna is really desirelessness; it is not an artificial attempt to abolish desires.</p>
<p>The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the desires.</p>
<p>A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to Krsna (isavasyam idam sarvam), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything.</p>
<p>This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization--namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is the eternal part and parcel of Krsna in spiritual identity and therefore the eternal position of the living entity is never on the level of Krsna or greater than Him.</p>
<p>This understanding of Krsna consciousness is the basic principle of real peace.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered.</p>
<p>Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One can attain Krsna consciousness or divine life at once, within a second--or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births.</p>
<p>It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact.</p>
<p>Khatvanga Maharaja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto Krsna.</p>
<p>Nirvana means ending the process of materialistic life.</p>
<p>According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-gita teaches differently.</p>
<p>Actual life begins after the completion of this material life.</p>
<p>For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life.</p>
<p>Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes Krsna conscious, he at once attains the stage of Brahma-nirvana.</p>
<p>There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom.</p>
<p>In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Attainment of Krsna consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in Krsna consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Brahman is just the opposite of matter.</p>
<p>Therefore brahmi sthitih means &quot;not on the platform of material activities.&quot;</p>
<p>Devotional service of the Lord is accepted in the Bhagavad-gita as the liberated stage.</p>
<p>Therefore, brahmi-sthitih is liberation from material bondage.</p>
<p>Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur has summarized this Second Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita as being the contents for the whole text.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavad-gita, the subject matters are karma-yoga, jnana-yoga, and bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>In the Second Chapter karma-yoga and jnana-yoga have been clearly discussed, and a glimpse of bhakti-yoga has also been given, as the contents for the complete text.</p>
