<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna said: I have heard Your instruction on confidential spiritual matters which You have so kindly delivered unto me, and my illusion is now dispelled.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This chapter reveals Krsna as the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>He is even the cause of the Maha-Visnu, and from Him the material universes emanate.</p>
<p>Krsna is not an incarnation; He is the source of all incarnations.</p>
<p>That has been completely explained in the last chapter.</p>
<p>Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over.</p>
<p>This means that Arjuna no longer thinks of Krsna as a mere human being, as a friend of his, but as the source of everything.</p>
<p>Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has a great friend like Krsna, but now he is thinking that although he may accept Krsna as the source of everything, others may not.</p>
<p>So in order to establish Krsna's divinity for all, he is requesting Krsna in this chapter to show His universal form.</p>
<p>Actually when one sees the universal form of Krsna one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but Krsna is so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original form.</p>
<p>Arjuna agrees to what Krsna says several times.</p>
<p>Krsna is speaking to him just for his benefit, and Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by Krsna's grace.</p>
<p>He is now convinced that Krsna is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone's heart as the Supersoul.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#112" id="112">11.2</a></h3>
<p>bhavapyayau hi bhutanam</p>
<p>srutau vistaraso maya</p>
<p>tvattah kamala-patraksa</p>

<p>bhava--appearance; apyayau--disappearance; hi--certainly; bhutanam--of all living entities; srutau--have heard; vistarasah--detail; maya--by me; tvattah--from You; kamala-patraksa--O lotus-eyed one; mahatmyam--glories; api--also; ca--and; avyayam--inexhaustible.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and disappearance of every living entity, as realized through Your inexhaustible glories.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna addresses Lord Krsna as &quot;lotus-eyed&quot; (Krsna's eyes appear just like the petals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for Krsna has assured him, in the last verse of the previous chapter, that He sustains the entire universe with just a fragment of Himself.</p>
<p>He is the source of everything in this material manifestation, and Arjuna has heard of this from the Lord in detail.</p>
<p>Arjuna further knows that in spite of His being the source of all appearances and disappearances, He is aloof from them.</p>
<p>His personality is not lost, although He is all-pervading.</p>
<p>That is the inconceivable opulence of Krsna which Arjuna admits that he has thoroughly understood.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#113" id="113">11.3</a></h3>
<p>evam etad yathattha tvam</p>
<p>atmanam paramesvara</p>

<p>evam--that; etat--this; yathattha--as it is; tvam--You; atmanam--the soul; paramesvara--the Supreme Lord; drastum--to see; icchami--I wish; te--You; rupam--form; aisvaram--divine; purusottama--O best of personalities.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O greatest of all personalities, O supreme form, though I see here before me Your actual position, I yet wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>I want to see that form of Yours.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal representation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on.</p>
<p>Now as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of Krsna, but in order to convince others in the future who may think that Krsna is an ordinary person, he desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see how He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart from it.</p>
<p>Arjuna's asking the Lord's permission is also significant.</p>
<p>Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special desire to see Him in His universal form, for he is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form of Krsna.</p>
<p>But He can understand also that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to convince others.</p>
<p>He did not have any personal desire for confirmation.</p>
<p>Krsna also understands that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God.</p>
<p>The people, therefore, should be careful; one who claims to be Krsna should be prepared to show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If You think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of all mystic power, then kindly show me that universal self.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the Supreme Lord, Krsna, by the material senses.</p>
<p>But if one is engaged in loving transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord by revelation.</p>
<p>Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Arjuna, as a devotee, does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges Krsna's inestimable position.</p>
<p>Arjuna could understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited infinite.</p>
<p>If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite.</p>
<p>The word yogesvara is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable power.</p>
<p>If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is unlimited.</p>
<p>Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of Krsna.</p>
<p>He does not give Krsna orders.</p>
<p>Krsna is not obliged to reveal Himself to anyone unless one surrenders fully in Krsna consciousness and engages in devotional service.</p>
<p>Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental speculations to see Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, O son of Prtha, behold now My opulences, hundreds of thousands of varied divine forms, multicolored like the sea.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna wanted to see Krsna in His universal form, which, although a transcendental form, is just manifested for the cosmic manifestation and is therefore subject to the temporary time of this material nature.</p>
<p>As the material nature is manifested and not manifested, similarly this universal form of Krsna is manifested and unmanifested.</p>
<p>It is not eternally situated in the spiritual sky like Krsna's other forms.</p>
<p>As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see Krsna in this way, Krsna reveals this form.</p>
<p>This universal form is not possible to be seen by any ordinary man.</p>
<p>Krsna must give one the power to see it.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Even though Arjuna was a personal friend of Krsna and the most advanced of learned men, it was still not possible for him to know everything about Krsna.</p>
<p>Here it is stated that humans have neither heard nor known of all these forms and manifestations.</p>
<p>Now Krsna reveals these wonderful forms.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>No one can see the entire universe sitting in one place.</p>
<p>Even the most advanced scientist cannot see what is going on in other parts of the universe.</p>
<p>Krsna gives him the power to see anything he wants to see, past, present and future.</p>
<p>Thus by the mercy of Krsna, Arjuna is able to see everything.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>But you cannot see Me with your present eyes.</p>
<p>Therefore I give to you divine eyes by which you can behold My mystic opulence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A pure devotee does not like to see Krsna in any form except His form with two hands; a devotee must see His universal form by His grace, not with the mind but with spiritual eyes.</p>
<p>To see the universal form of Krsna, Arjuna is told not to change his mind but his vision.</p>
<p>The universal form of Krsna is not very important; that will be clear in the verses.</p>
<p>Yet because Arjuna wanted to see it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal form.</p>
<p>Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with Krsna are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences.</p>
<p>The playmates of Krsna, the friends of Krsna and the parents of Krsna never want Krsna to show His opulences.</p>
<p>They are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In their loving exchange they forget that Krsna is the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that the boys who play with Krsna are all highly pious souls, and after many, many births they are able to play with Krsna.</p>
<p>Such boys do not know that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>They take Him as a personal friend.</p>
<p>The Supreme Person is considered as the impersonal Brahman by great sages, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the devotees, and as a product of this material nature by ordinary men.</p>
<p>The fact is that the devotee is not concerned to see the visva-rupa, the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate Krsna's statement so that in the future people could understand that Krsna not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna.</p>
<p>Arjuna must confirm this because Arjuna is the beginning of the parampara system.</p>
<p>Those who are actually interested to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that Krsna not only theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the Supreme.</p>
<p>The Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already explained.</p>

<p>These two verses indicate that there is no limit to the hands, mouths, legs, etc., of the Lord.</p>

<p>It indicates that both Arjuna and Krsna were sitting on the chariot when Arjuna saw the universal form.</p>

<p>tatah--thereafter; sah--he; vismayavistah--being overwhelmed with wonder; hrsta-roma--with his bodily hairs standing on end due to his great ecstasy; dhananjayah--Arjuna ; pranamya--offering obeisances; sirasa--with the head; devam--to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; krtanjalih--with folded hands; abhasata--began to say.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Then, bewildered and astonished, his hair standing on end, Arjuna began to pray with folded hands, offering obeisances to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Once the divine vision is revealed, the relationship between Krsna and Arjuna changes immediately.</p>
<p>Before, Krsna and Arjuna had a relationship based on friendship, but here, after the revelation, Arjuna is offering obeisances with great respect, and with folded hands he is praying to Krsna.</p>
<p>He is praising the universal form.</p>
<p>Thus Arjuna's relationship becomes one of wonder rather than friendship.</p>
<p>Great devotees see Krsna as the reservoir of all relationships.</p>
<p>In the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned, and all of them are present in Krsna.</p>
<p>It is said that He is the ocean of all the relationships exchanged between two living entities, between the gods, or between the Supreme Lord and His devotees.</p>
<p>It is said that Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the Supreme Lord with folded hands.</p>
<p>He was not, of course, afraid.</p>
<p>He was affected by the wonders of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The immediate context is wonder; his natural loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus he reacted in this way.</p>

<p>Arjuna said: My dear Lord Krsna, I see assembled together in Your body all the demigods and various other living entities.</p>
<p>I see Brahma sitting on the lotus flower as well as Lord Siva and many sages and divine serpents.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna sees everything in the universe; therefore he sees Brahma, who is the first creature in the universe, and the celestial serpent upon which the Garbhodakasayi Visnu lies in the lower regions of the universe.</p>
<p>This snake bed is called Vasuki.</p>
<p>There are also other snakes known as Vasuki.</p>
<p>Arjuna can see from the Garbhodakasayi Visnu up to the topmost part of the universe on the lotus-flower planet where Brahma, the first creature of the universe, resides.</p>
<p>That means that from the beginning to the end, everything could be seen by Arjuna sitting in one place on his chariot.</p>
<p>This was possible by the grace of the Supreme Lord, Krsna.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the extent of the six opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Here and in many other places there is repetition, but according to the scriptures, repetition of the glories of Krsna is not a literary weakness.</p>

<p>With the exception of you [the Pandavas], all the soldiers here on both sides will be slain.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Arjuna knew that Krsna was his friend and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was nonetheless puzzled by the various forms exhibited by Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force.</p>
<p>It is written in the Vedas that the Supreme Truth destroys everything, even Brahma.</p>
<p>Yasya brahme ca ksatram ca ubhe bhavata odanah mrtyur yasyopasecanam ka ittha veda yatra sah.</p>
<p>Eventually all the brahmanas, ksatriyas and everyone else are devoured by the Supreme.</p>
<p>This form of the Supreme Lord is an all-devouring giant, and here Krsna presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time.</p>
<p>Except for a few Pandavas, everyone who was present in that battlefield would be devoured by Him.</p>
<p>Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight; then there would be no frustration.</p>
<p>In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that is His plan.</p>
<p>If he stopped fighting, they would die in another way.</p>
<p>Death cannot be checked, even if he did not fight.</p>
<p>In fact, they were already dead.</p>
<p>Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>That is the law of nature.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#1133" id="1133">11.33</a></h3>

<p>After conquering your enemies you will enjoy a flourishing kingdom.</p>
<p>They are already put to death by My arrangement, and you, O Savyasacin, can be but an instmment in the fight.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Savyasacin refers to one who can shoot arrows very expertly in the field; thus Arjuna is addressed as an expert warrior capable of delivering arrows to kill his enemies.</p>
<p>&quot;Just become an instrument&quot;: nimitta-matram.</p>
<p>This word is also very significant.</p>
<p>The whole world is moving according to the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but accidental formations.</p>
<p>There are many so-called scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of &quot;perhaps&quot; and &quot;maybe.&quot;</p>
<p>There is a specific plan being carried out in this material world.</p>
<p>What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home.</p>
<p>As long they have the domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they are conditioned.</p>
<p>But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and cultivate Krsna consciousness is most intelligent.</p>
<p>The creation and destruction of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God.</p>
<p>Thus the Battle of Kuruksetra was fought according to the plan of God.</p>
<p>Arjuna was refusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight and at the same time desire the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Then he would be happy.</p>
<p>If one is in full Krsna consciousness and if his life is devoted to His transcendental service, he is perfect.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Every plan is made by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He is so kind and merciful to His devotees that He wants to give the credit to His devotees who carry out His plan according to His desire.</p>
<p>Life should therefore move in such a way that everyone acts in Krsna consciousness and understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the medium of a spiritual master.</p>
<p>The plans of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are understood by His mercy, and the plans of the devotees are as good as His plans.</p>

<p>Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra: O King, after hearing these words from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna trembled, fearfully offered obeisances with folded hands and began, falteringly, to speak as follows:</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As we have already explained, because of the situation created by the universal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna became bewildered in wonder; thus he began to offer his respectful obeisances to Krsna again and again, and with faltering voice he began to pray, not as a friend, but as a devotee in wonder.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Hrsikesa, the world becomes joyful upon hearing Your name and thus everyone becomes attached to You.</p>
<p>Although the perfected beings offer You their respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there.</p>
<p>All this is rightly done.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna, after hearing from Krsna about the outcome of the Battle of Kuruksetra, became an enlightened devotee of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He admitted that everything done by Krsna is quite fit.</p>
<p>Arjuna confirmed that Krsna is the maintainer and the object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables.</p>
<p>His actions are equally good for all.</p>
<p>Arjuna understood herein that when the Battle of Kuruksetra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many demigods, siddhas, and the intelligentia of the higher planets, and they were observing the fight because Krsna was present there.</p>
<p>When Arjuna saw the universal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who were demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised.</p>
<p>Out of their natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fled.</p>
<p>Krsna's treatment of the devotees and the atheists is praised by Arjuna.</p>
<p>In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows that whatever He does is good for all.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O great one, who stands above even Brahma, You are the original master.</p>
<p>Why should they not offer their homage up to You, O limitless one? O refuge of the universe, You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this material manifestation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that Krsna is worshipable by everyone.</p>
<p>He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul.</p>
<p>Arjuna is addressing Krsna as mahatma, which means that He is most magnanimous and unlimited.</p>
<p>Ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the influence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and devesa means that He is the controller of all demigods and is above them all.</p>
<p>He is the center of the whole universe.</p>
<p>Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living entities and all powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him because no one is greater than Him.</p>
<p>He especially mentions that Krsna is greater than Brahma because Brahma is created by Him.</p>
<p>Brahma is born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodakasayi Visnu, who is Krsna's plenary expansion; therefore Brahma and Lord Siva, who is born of Brahma, and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord is respected by Lord Siva and Brahma and similar other demigods.</p>
<p>The word aksaram is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction, but the Lord is above this material creation.</p>
<p>He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself.</p>
<p>He is therefore the all-great Supreme.</p>

<p>Everything is resting on the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He is the ultimate rest.</p>
<p>Nidhanam means that everything, even the Brahman effulgence, rests on the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna.</p>
<p>He is the knower of everything that is happening in this world, and if knowledge has any end, He is the end of all knowledge; therefore He is the known and the knowable.</p>

<p>The Lord is addressed here as air because the air is the most important representation of all the demigods, being all-pervasive.</p>
<p>Arjuna also addresses Krsna as the grandfather because He is the father of Brahma, the first living creature in the universe.</p>

<p>I have dishonored You many times while relaxing or while lying on the same bed or eating together, sometimes alone and sometimes in front of many friends.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Krsna is manifested before Arjuna in His universal form, Arjuna remembers his friendly relationship with Krsna and is therefore asking pardon and requesting Him to excuse him for the many informal gestures which arise out of friendship.</p>
<p>He is admitting that formerly he did not know that Krsna could assume such a universal form, although He explained it as his intimate friend.</p>
<p>Arjuna did not know how many times he may have dishonored Him by addressing Him as &quot;O my friend, O Krsna, O Yadava,&quot; etc., without acknowledging His opulence.</p>
<p>But Krsna is so kind and merciful that in spite of such opulence He played with Arjuna as a friend.</p>
<p>Such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between the devotee and the Lord.</p>
<p>The relationship between the living entity and Krsna is fixed eternally; it cannot be forgotten, as we can see from the behavior of Arjuna.</p>
<p>Although Arjuna has seen the opulence in the universal form, he could not forget his friendly relationship with Krsna.</p>

<p>No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You.</p>
<p>Within the three worlds, You are immeasurable.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord Krsna is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son.</p>
<p>He is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahma, and presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna; therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from Krsna.</p>
<p>Without being a representative of Krsna, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.</p>
<p>The Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects.</p>
<p>He is of immeasurable greatness.</p>
<p>No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, because no one is equal to or higher than Krsna within any manifestation, spiritual or material.</p>
<p>Everyone is below Him.</p>
<p>No one can excel Him.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord Krsna has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him there is no difference between His senses, body, mind and Himself.</p>
<p>Foolish persons who do not know Him perfectly say that Krsna is different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else.</p>
<p>Krsna is absolute; therefore His activities and potencies are supreme.</p>
<p>It is also stated that He does not have senses like ours.</p>
<p>He can perform all sensual activities; therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited.</p>
<p>No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to Him, and everyone is lower than Him.</p>
<p>Whoever knows His transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting his body, returns to Him and doesn't come back again to this miserable world.</p>
<p>Therefore one should know that Krsna's activities are different from others.</p>
<p>The best policy is to follow the principles of Krsna; that will make one perfect.</p>
<p>It is also stated that there is no one who is master of Krsna; everyone is His servant.</p>
<p>Only Krsna is God, and everyone is servant.</p>
<p>Everyone is complying with His order.</p>
<p>There is no one who can deny His order.</p>
<p>Everyone is acting according to His direction, being under His superintendence.</p>

<p>After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am gladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear.</p>
<p>Therefore please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of Godhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna is always in confidence with Krsna because he is a very dear friend, and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend's opulence, Arjuna is very joyful to see that his friend, Krsna, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can show such a wonderful universal form.</p>
<p>But at the same time, after seeing that universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to Krsna out of his unalloyed friendship.</p>
<p>Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he had no reason to fear.</p>
<p>Arjuna therefore is asking Krsna to show His Narayana form because He can assume any form.</p>
<p>This universal form is material and temporary, as the material world is temporary.</p>
<p>But in the Vaikuntha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as Narayana.</p>
<p>There are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them Krsna is present by His plenary manifestations of different names.</p>
<p>Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the Vaikuntha planets.</p>
<p>Of course in each Vaikuntha planet the form of Narayana is four-handed, and the four hands hold different symbols, the conchshell, mace, lotus and disc.</p>
<p>According to the different hands these four things are held in, the Narayanas are named.</p>
<p>All of these forms are one and the same to Krsna; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature.</p>

<p>I long to see You in that form.</p>

<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Lord is eternally situated in hundreds and thousands of forms, and the main forms are those like Rama, Nrsimha, Narayana, etc.</p>
<p>There are innumerable forms.</p>
<p>But Arjuna knew that Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead assuming His temporary universal form.</p>
<p>He is now asking to see the form of Narayana, a spiritual form.</p>
<p>This verse establishes without any doubt the statement of the Srimad-Bhagavatam that Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead and all other features originate from Him.</p>
<p>He is not different from His plenary expansions, and He is God in any of His innumerable forms.</p>
<p>In all of these forms He is fresh like a young man.</p>
<p>That is the constant feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>No one before you has ever seen this unlimited and glaringly effulgent form.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so out of His mercy upon His devotee Arjuna, Lord Krsna showed His universal form full of effulgence and opulence.</p>
<p>This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces were rapidly changing.</p>
<p>Krsna showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His friend Arjuna.</p>
<p>This form was manifested by Krsna through His internal potency, which is inconceivable by human speculation.</p>
<p>No one had seen this universal form of the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was shown to Arjuna, other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also see it.</p>
<p>They did not see it before, but because of Arjuna they were also able to see it.</p>
<p>In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the universal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of Krsna.</p>
<p>Someone commented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when Krsna went to Duryodhana to negotiate for peace.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the peace offer, but at that time Krsna manifested some of His universal forms.</p>
<p>But those forms are different from this one shown to Arjuna.</p>

<p>O best of the Kuru warriors, no one before you has ever seen this universal form of Mine, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by performing sacrifices, nor by charities or similar activities can this form be seen.</p>
<p>Only you have seen this.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood.</p>
<p>Who can have divine vision? Divine means godly.</p>
<p>Unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision.</p>
<p>And what is a demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Visnu are demigods.</p>
<p>Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Visnu, or who only recognize the impersonal part of Krsna as the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision.</p>
<p>It is not possible to decry Krsna and at the same time have the divine vision.</p>
<p>One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine.</p>
<p>In other words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gita gives the description of the universal form, and this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna.</p>
<p>Now one can have some idea of the visva-rupa after this incidence; those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the Lord.</p>
<p>But one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of Krsna.</p>
<p>The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested to see the universal form of the Lord.</p>
<p>As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord Krsna as Visnu, and he was actually afraid of the universal form.</p>
<p>In this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yajnadhya-yanaih, which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial regulations.</p>
<p>Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, namely the four Vedas (Rk, Yajus, Sama and Atharva) and the eighteen Puranas and Upanisads, and Vedanta-sutra.</p>
<p>One can study these at home or anywhere else.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are sutras, Kalpa-sutras and Mimamsa-sutras, for studying the method of sacrifice.</p>
<p>Danaih refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the brahmanas and the Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>Similarly, pious activities refer to the agni-hotra, etc., the prescribed duties of the different castes.</p>
<p>Pious activities and the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains are called tapasya.</p>
<p>So one can perform all these, can accept bodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas, etc., but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that universal form.</p>
<p>Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-gita we understand that the impersonalists are not devotees.</p>
<p>Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.</p>
<p>There are many persons who create incarnations.</p>
<p>They falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness.</p>
<p>We should follow the principles of Bhagavad-gita, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>Although Bhagavad-gita is considered the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that one can distinguish what is what.</p>
<p>The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form, but that is not acceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of Krsna, one cannot see the universal form of God.</p>
<p>So one first of all has to become a pure devotee of Krsna; then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen.</p>
<p>A devotee of Krsna cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of Bhagavad-gita Arjuna was worried about killing Bhisma and Drona, his worshipful grandfathers and masters.</p>
<p>But Krsna said that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather.</p>
<p>When they tried to disrobe Draupadi in the assembly, Bhisma and Drona were silent, and for such negligence of duty they should be killed.</p>
<p>Krsna showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him that these people were already killed for their unlawful action.</p>
<p>That scene was shown to Arjuna because devotees are always peaceful, and they cannot perform such horrible actions.</p>
<p>The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and Krsna showed him.</p>
<p>A devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one to reciprocate loving feelings.</p>
<p>A devotee wants to offer his respectful worshiping feelings; thus he wants to see the two-handed or four-handed Krsna form so he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Krsna appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki, He first of all appeared as four-armed Narayana, but when He was requested by His parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child in appearance.</p>
<p>Similarly, Krsna knew that Arjuna was not interested in seeing a four-handed form of Krsna, but since he asked to see this four-handed form, He also showed him this form again and then showed Himself in His two-handed form.</p>
<p>The word saumya-vapuh is very significant.</p>
<p>Saumya-vapu is a very beautiful form; it is known as the most beautiful form.</p>
<p>When He was present, everyone was attracted simply by Krsna's form, and because Krsna is director of the universe, He just banished the fear of Arjuna, His devotee, and showed him again His beautiful form of Krsna.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that only a person whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of love can see the beautiful form of Sri Krsna.</p>

<p>When Arjuna thus saw Krsna in His original form, he said: Seeing this humanlike form, so very beautiful, my mind is now pacified, and I am restored to my original nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here the words manusam rupam clearly indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be originally two-handed.</p>
<p>Those who deride Krsna to be an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of His divine nature.</p>
<p>If Krsna is like an ordinary human being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and again to show the four-handed Narayana form? So it is very clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita that one who thinks that Krsna is an ordinary person and misguides the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within Krsna speaking, is doing the greatest injustice.</p>
<p>Krsna has actually shown His universal form and His fourhanded Visnu form.</p>
<p>So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on Bhagavad-gita because he knows what is what.</p>
<p>The original verses of Bhagavad-gita are as clear as the sun; they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, the form which you are now seeing is very difficult to behold.</p>
<p>Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see this form which is so dear.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord Krsna concluded revealing His universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by so many activities, sacrifices, etc.</p>
<p>Now here the word sudurdarsam is used, indicating that Krsna's two-handed form is still more confidential.</p>
<p>One may be able to see the universal form of Krsna by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penance, Vedic study and philosophical speculation, etc.</p>
<p>It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti, one cannot see; that has already been explained.</p>
<p>Still, beyond that universal form, the form of Krsna as a two-handed man is still more difficult to see, even for demigods like Brahma and Lord Siva.</p>
<p>They desire to see Him, and we have evidences in the Srimad-Bhagavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, Devaki, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of Krsna.</p>
<p>They even waited to see Him.</p>
<p>A foolish person may deride Him, but that is an ordinary person.</p>
<p>Krsna is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahma and Siva in His two-armed form.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita it is also confirmed that He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him.</p>
<p>Krsna's body, as confirmed by Brahma-samhita and confirmed by Himself in Bhagavad-gita, is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality.</p>
<p>His body is never like a material body.</p>
<p>But for some who make a study of Krsna by reading Bhagavad-gita or similar Vedic scriptures, Krsna is a problem.</p>
<p>For one using a material process, Krsna is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher.</p>
<p>But He isn't an ordinary man.</p>
<p>But some think that even though He was so powerful, He had to accept a material body.</p>
<p>Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature.</p>
<p>This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Another calculation is speculative.</p>
<p>Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on Krsna and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Thus some think that the universal form of Krsna which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form.</p>
<p>According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary.</p>
<p>They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person.</p>
<p>But the transcendental process is described in Bhagavad-gita, Chapter Two: to hear about Krsna from authorities.</p>
<p>That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about Krsna from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, Krsna becomes dear.</p>
<p>As we have several times discussed, Krsna is covered by His yoga-maya potency.</p>
<p>He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute Truth can actually be understood.</p>
<p>The transcendentalist, by continuous Krsna consciousness and by devotional service to Krsna, can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see Krsna by revelation.</p>
<p>Such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand Krsna, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing Krsna in His two-handed form.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of Krsna is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more difficult to understand His personal form as Syamasundara.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna first appeared before His parents Devaki and Vasudeva in a four-handed form, and then He transformed Himself into the two-handed form.</p>
<p>This mystery is very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of devotional service.</p>
<p>For scholars who have simply studied Vedic literature by way of speculation or out of mere academic interest, Krsna is not easy to understand.</p>
<p>Nor is He to he understood by persons who officially go to the temple to offer worship.</p>
<p>They make their visit, but they cannot understand Krsna as He is.</p>
<p>Krsna can be understood only through the path of devotional service, as explained by Krsna Himself in the next verse.</p>

<p>My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly.</p>
<p>Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service.</p>
<p>He explicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-gita by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time.</p>
<p>No one can understand Krsna or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated here that no one can see Him.</p>
<p>Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways.</p>
<p>There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand Krsna, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature.</p>
<p>One can perform penance in accordance with those principles.</p>
<p>As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of Krsna who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the Krsna philosophy or Krsna consciousness throughout the world.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is a benediction to humanity.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya was appreciated by Rupa Gosvami as the most munificent man of charity because love of Krsna, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him.</p>
<p>And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of Visnu or Krsna), that is a chance to progress.</p>
<p>For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is very essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation.</p>
<p>For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand Krsna.</p>
<p>The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding Krsna.</p>
<p>The personal forms of Krsna, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna.</p>
<p>The four-handed form is Narayana, and the two-handed form is Krsna; they are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary.</p>
<p>The very word sudurdarsam, meaning difficult to see, suggests that no one saw that universal form.</p>
<p>It also suggests that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it.</p>
<p>That form was exhibited by Krsna at the request of Arjuna because in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.</p>
<p>Krsna changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of Narayana and then to His own natural form of two hands.</p>
<p>This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed Krsna.</p>
<p>He is the origin of all emanations.</p>
<p>Krsna is distinct even from these forms, not to speak of the impersonal conception.</p>
<p>As far as the four-handed forms of Krsna are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of Krsna (which is known as Maha-Visnu, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge.</p>
<p>He is the source of all forms of Visnu, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature it is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person.</p>
<p>His name is Krsna, and He sometimes descends on this earth.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Srimad-Bhagavatam there is a description of all kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there it is said that Krsna is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.</p>
<p>Krsnas tu bhagavan svayam.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, mattah parataram nanyat: &quot;There is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead Krsna.&quot;</p>
<p>He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita, aham adir hi devanam: &quot;I am the origin of all the demigods.&quot;</p>
<p>And after understanding Bhagavad-gita from Krsna, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan: &quot;I now fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore the universal form which Krsna showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God.</p>
<p>The original is the Krsna form.</p>
<p>The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God.</p>
<p>It is not God's original form.</p>
<p>The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships.</p>
<p>The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with Krsna in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful.</p>
<p>Arjuna, who is a constant companion of Krsna's, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man.</p>
<p>Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form.</p>
<p>This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service, the two-handed form of Krsna is the most dear.</p>

<p>My dear Arjuna, one who is engaged in My pure devotional service, free from the contaminations of previous activities and from mental speculation, who is friendly to every living entity, certainly comes to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who wants to approach the Supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the Krsnaloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme Personality, Krsna, must take this formula, as is stated by the Supreme Himself.</p>
<p>Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gita is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gita is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the Supreme Spiritual Personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service.</p>
<p>As far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to Krsna conscious activities.</p>
<p>No work should be done by any man except in relationship to Krsna.</p>
<p>This called Krsna-karma.</p>
<p>One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be done for Him.</p>
<p>For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into Krsna consciousness, one has to do business for Krsna.</p>
<p>If Krsna is the proprietor of the business, then Krsna should enjoy the profit of the business.</p>
<p>If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to Krsna, he can do it.</p>
<p>This is work for Krsna.</p>
<p>Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for Krsna, and he can install the Deity of Krsna and arrange for the Deity's service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service.</p>
<p>This is all Krsna-karma.</p>
<p>One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to Krsna.</p>
<p>One should also accept as prasadam, food, the remnants of offerings to Krsna.</p>
<p>If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for Krsna, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of Krsna; that is also Krsna-karma.</p>
<p>One can cultivate a garden.</p>
<p>Anyone who has land--in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land--can utilize that for Krsna by growing flowers to offer Him.</p>
<p>He can sow tulasi plants because tulasi leaves are very important, and Krsna has recommended this in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Krsna desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or a little water--and He is satisfied.</p>
<p>This leaf especially refers to the tulasi So one can sow tulasi leaves and pour water on the plant.</p>
<p>Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of Krsna.</p>
<p>These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for Krsna.</p>
<p>The word mat-paramah refers to one who considers the association of Krsna in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life.</p>
<p>Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka.</p>
<p>He has no attraction for that.</p>
<p>He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely Krsnaloka, Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
<p>He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other.</p>
<p>As indicated by the word mad-bhaktah, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him.</p>
<p>One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.</p>
<p>The term sanga-varjitah is very significant.</p>
<p>One should disassociate himself from persons who are against Krsna.</p>
<p>Not only are the atheistic persons against Krsna, but also those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation.</p>
<p>Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu as follows: anyabhilasita-sunyam jnana-karmady-anavrtam anukulyena krsnanusilanam bhaktir uttama.</p>
<p>In this verse Srila Rupa Gosvami clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination.</p>
<p>He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation.</p>
<p>When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of Krsna, that is called pure devotional service.</p>
<p>Anukulyasya sankaplah pratikulyasya varjanam.</p>
<p>One should think of Krsna and act for Krsna favorably, not unfavorably.</p>
<p>Kamsa was an enemy of Krsna's.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of Krsna's birth, he planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always Krsna conscious in every respect, but that Krsna consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of Krsna twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and Krsna at last killed him.</p>
<p>Of course anyone who is killed by Krsna attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee.</p>
<p>The pure devotee does not even want salvation.</p>
<p>He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
<p>His only objective is to serve Krsna wherever he may be.</p>
<p>A devotee of Krsna is friendly to everyone.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy.</p>
<p>How is this? A devotee situated in Krsna consciousness knows that only devotional service to Krsna can relieve a person from all the problems of life.</p>
<p>He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, Krsna consciousness, into human society.</p>
<p>There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord risking their lives for the spreading of God consciousness.</p>
<p>The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>He was crucified by the nondevotees, but He sacrificed His life for spreading God consciousness.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be superficial to understand that He was killed.</p>
<p>Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as Thakur Haridasa.</p>
<p>Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread Krsna consciousness, and it is difficult.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person knows that if a man is suffering, it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one's neighbor from all material problems.</p>
<p>In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Now, we can imagine how merciful Krsna is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him.</p>
<p>Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.</p>
<p>In summary, the universal form of Krsna, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Visnu, four-handed, have all been exhibited by Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus Krsna is the origin of all these manifestations.</p>
<p>It is not that Krsna is a manifestation of the original visva-rupa, or Visnu.</p>
<p>Krsna is the origin of all forms.</p>
<p>There are hundreds and thousands of Visnus, but for a devotee, no form of Krsna is important but the original form, two-handed Syamasundara.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that those who are attached to the Syamasundara form of Krsna in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else.</p>
<p>One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of Krsna is essential and supreme.</p>
